abstract = {BACKGROUND: Models of codon evolution have proven useful for investigating the strength and direction of natural selection. In some cases, a priori biological knowledge has been used successfully to model heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics among codon sites. These are called fixed-effect models, and they require that all codon sites are assigned to one of several partitions which are permitted to have independent parameters for selection pressure, evolutionary rate, transition to transversion ratio or codon frequencies. For single gene analysis, partitions might be defined according to protein tertiary structure, and for multiple gene analysis partitions might be defined according to a gene's functional category. Given a set of related fixed-effect models, the task of selecting the model that best fits the data is not trivial. RESULTS: In this study, we implement a set of fixed-effect codon models which allow for different levels of heterogeneity among partitions in the substitution process. We describe strategies for selecting among these models by a backward elimination procedure, Akaike information criterion (AIC) or a corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). We evaluate the performance of these model selection methods via a simulation study, and make several recommendations for real data analysis. Our simulation study indicates that the backward elimination procedure can provide a reliable method for model selection in this setting. We also demonstrate the utility of these models by application to a single-gene dataset partitioned according to tertiary structure (abalone sperm lysin), and a multi-gene dataset partitioned according to the functional category of the gene (flagellar-related proteins of Listeria). CONCLUSION: Fixed-effect models have advantages and disadvantages. Fixed-effect models are desirable when data partitions are known to exhibit significant heterogeneity or when a statistical test of such heterogeneity is desired. They have the disadvantage of requiring a priori knowledge for partitioning sites. We recommend: (i) selection of models by using backward elimination rather than AIC or AICc, (ii) use a stringent cut-off, e.g., p = 0.0001, and (iii) conduct sensitivity analysis of results. With thoughtful application, fixed-effect codon models should provide a useful tool for large scale multi-gene analyses.},

abstract = {The Indo-Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans is widespread both in its native and its non-native habitats. The rapid invasion of this top predator has had a marked negative effect on fish populations in the Western Atlantic and the Caribbean. It is now well documented that lionfish are invading many tropical and sub-tropical habitats. However, there are fewer data available on the change in lionfish abundance over time and the variation of body size and diet across habitats. A recent study in San Salvador, Bahamas, found body size differences between individuals from mangrove and reef systems. That study further suggested that ontogenetic investigation of habitat use patterns could help clarify whether lionfish are using the mangrove areas of San Salvador as nurseries. The aim of the present study is to determine temporal trends in lionfish relative abundance in mangrove and reef systems in San Salvador, and to further assess whether there is evidence suggesting an ontogenetic shift from mangroves to reef areas. Accordingly, we collected lionfish from mangrove and reef habitats and calculated catch per unit effort (a proxy for relative abundance), compared body size distributions across these two systems, and employed a combination of stable isotope, stomach content, and genetic analyses of prey, to evaluate differences in lionfish trophic interactions and habitat use patterns. Our results show that populations may have increased in San Salvador during the last 4 years, and that there is a strong similarity in body size between habitats, stark differences in prey items, and no apparent overlap in the use of habitat and/or food resources. These results suggest that there is not evidence an for ontogenetic shift from mangroves to reefs, and support other studies that propose lionfish are opportunistic forages with little movement across habitats.},

abstract = {A considerable amount of vertebrate remains have been found in the upper Messinian Cassano Spinola Conglomerates Formation, which crops out along the Tanaro River near Verduno (Piedmont). The fossil-bearing deposits were deposited during the third stage of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.55-5.33 Ma) in connection with the 'Lago-Mare' event. Sedimentological evidence indicates that the deposition of this Formation originated in a variety of fresh- and brackish-water environments. This is the most diverse Late Miocene faunal community found in NW Italy up to now, and includes remains of fish (cyprinodontiforms and putative lophiiforms), amphibians (bufonids, ranids), reptiles (testudinids, geoemydids, lacertids, anguids, varanids, agamids, amphisbaenians, scolecophidians, colubrids), birds (galliforms, accipitriforms and strigiforms) and mammals (proboscideans, perissodactyls, artiodactyls, carnivores, insectivores, rodents and lagomorphs). The tetrapod assemblages are consistent with the late Turolian age inferred based on sedimentological evidence and indicative of an open, semi-arid woodland savanna with at least modest, sparse fresh and brackish water bodies. The Verduno fossil assemblages share faunal similarities with coeval ones of southwest, central, and eastern Europe, as well as of peninsular Italy. Located at the crossroads between the two sides of the Mediterranean, northwestern Italy witnessed faunal exchanges between the different corners of the European continent. It was also on the access pathway to the Italian peninsula. The Verduno assemblage made it possible to track the migration of several taxa during latest Miocene across the whole southern Europe.},

abstract = {In isolated oceanic islands, colonization patterns are often interpreted as resulting from dispersal rather than vicariant events. Such inferences may not be appropriate when island associations change over time and new islands do not form in a simple linear trend. Further complexity in the phylogeography of ocean islands arises when dealing with endangered taxa as extinctions, uncertainty on the number of evolutionary 'units', and human activities can obscure the progression of colonization events. Here, we address these issues through a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of giant Gal{\'{a}}pagos tortoises, integrating DNA data from extinct and extant species with information on recent human activities and newly available geological data. Our results show that only three of the five extinct or nearly extinct species should be considered independent evolutionary units. Dispersal from mainland South America started at approximately 3.2 Ma after the emergence of the two oldest islands of San Cristobal and Espa{\~{n}}ola. Dispersal from older to younger islands began approximately 1.74 Ma and was followed by multiple colonizations from different sources within the archipelago. Vicariant events, spurred by island formation, coalescence, and separation, contributed to lineage diversifications on Pinz{\'{o}}n and Floreana dating from 1.26 and 0.85 Ma. This work provides an example of how to reconstruct the history of endangered taxa in spite of extinctions and human-mediated dispersal events and highlights the need to take into account both vicariance and dispersal when dealing with organisms from islands whose associations are not simply explained by a linear emergence model.},

Evidence from paleontology, climatology, archaeology, and ecology now supports the idea that humans contributed to extinction on some continents, but human hunting was not solely responsible for the pattern of extinction everywhere. Instead, evidence suggests that the intersection of human impacts with pronounced climatic change drove the precise timing and geography of extinction in the Northern Hemisphere. The story from the Southern Hemisphere is still unfolding. New evidence from Australia supports the view that humans helped cause extinctions there, but the correlation with climate is weak or contested. Firmer chronologies, more realistic ecological models, and regional paleoecological insights still are needed to understand details of the worldwide extinction pattern and the population dynamics of the species involved.},

abstract = {The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3–136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.Estudiando el Potencial para Restaurar Ecosistemas Hist{\'{o}}ricos de Forrajeo con Reemplazos Ecol{\'{o}}gicos de Tortugas Terrestres},

abstract = {Ancient DNA of extinct species from the Pleistocene and Holocene has provided valuable evolutionary insights. However, these are largely restricted to mammals and high latitudes because DNA preservation in warm climates is typically poor. In the tropics and subtropics, non-avian reptiles constitute a significant part of the fauna and little is known about the genetics of the many extinct reptiles from tropical islands. We have reconstructed the near-complete mitochondrial genome of an extinct giant tortoise from the Bahamas (Chelonoidis alburyorum) using an approximately 1 000-year-old humerus from a water-filled sinkhole (blue hole) on Great Abaco Island. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses place this extinct species as closely related to Gal{\'{a}}pagos (C. niger complex) and Chaco tortoises (C. chilensis), and provide evidence for repeated overseas dispersal in this tortoise group. The ancestors of extant Chelonoidis species arrived in South America from Africa only after the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and dispersed from there to the Caribbean and the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands. Our results also suggest that the anoxic, thermally buffered environment of blue holes may enhance DNA preservation, and thus are opening a window for better understanding evolution and population history of extinct tropical species, which would likely still exist without human impact.},

abstract = {Die Kelders Cave 1, South Africa, has provided more than 150,000 taxonomically identifiable mammal and tortoise bones from Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) deposits. Cape dune molerats dominate the mammal sample, and they appear to have been accumulated mainly by people during the LSA occupation and mainly by eagle owls in the MSA. In sharp contrast to the LSA fauna, the MSA sample contains extralimital ungulates that imply relatively moist, grassy conditions. The large mean size of the MSA molerats also points to greater humidity, while the large size of the gray mongooses implies cooler temperatures. The sum supports luminescence and ESR dates that place the MSA occupation within the early part of the Last Glaciation (global isotope stage 4). The Die Kelders ungulate bones support those from Klasies River Mouth in suggesting that MSA people obtained dangerous terrestrial prey much less frequently than their LSA successors, probably because MSA people lacked the bow and arrow and other projectile weapons. The Die Kelders tortoise bones constrain the extent of climatic change, since their abundance indicates that warm, dry days remained common, at least seasonally. The tortoises tend to be much larger in the MSA layers than in the LSA ones, suggesting that MSA people collected tortoises less intensively, probably because MSA populations were relatively sparse.},

abstract = {Fossil marine lineages are generally expected to exhibit long-term trends of increasing body size because of inherent fitness advantages or secular changes in environmental conditions. Because empirical documentation of this trend during the Paleozoic has been lacking for most taxonomic groups, the magnitude, timing, and taxonomic breadth of the trend have remained elusive. This study uses the largest existing database of fossil invertebrate sizes from four faunally important phyla to document ecosystem-wide size trends in well-preserved biotas from deep-subtidal, soft-substrate assemblages during the Cambrian through Devonian. Size of type specimens was measured along standard body axes from monographic plates and converted to body volume by using a broadly applicable empirical regression. Results demonstrate that mean body size (herein volume) of individual genera doubles during this interval, especially from the Late Ordovician through Early Devonian. The timing is gradual in spite of major radiations and extinctions, and the increase is primarily attributable to a net increase in the three-dimensionality of genera. The overall increase is not caused by replacement among clades because increases are widespread among arthropods, brachiopods, and echinoderms, at the phylum and class levels; in contrast, mollusks do not display a net size change at either taxonomic level. The increase is also more pronounced in microbivores than in carnivores. Combined with known environmental changes during this interval, and especially records of carbon dioxide, these trends provide support for the claim that primary productivity increased during the early to mid Paleozoic.},

abstract = {Subsistence hunting among theWaimiri Atroari Indians in central Amazonia, Brazil, was stud- ied from September 1993 to October 1994 to assess the current levels of resource exploitation. Hunting effort, harvesting yields and species composition of the hunt were recorded daily in five villages varying in number of people, location and age of the settlement. The Waimiri Atroari harvested a total of 3004 individuals of 41 species in one year. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (T. tajacu) and spider monkey (Ateles paniscus) represented 87{\%} of the total yearly game weight. Sex ratios of spider monkeys killed were heavily biased towards females indicating a stronger hunting pressure on those individuals. Harvesting yields was proportional to hunting efforts indic- ating no evident game depletion in the study period. However, capture per unit of effort was significantly different among villages. Differences in total game mass harvested may be explained by local resource depletion associated with age and size of the settlement. However, this relationship is confounded by the capacity of some villages to exploit distant hunting sites. Data obtained in one village showed that harvest rates were higher in hunting sites located far from settlement indicating game depletion in hunting sites surrounding the village.},

abstract = {Environmental fluctuations are a driving force in vertebrate evolution, but cryptobranchids (giant salamanders) show little morphologic change since the Jurassic. Here we analyze their fossil distribution in the Cenozoic of Eurasia and show that morphologic stasis is also maintained by stable environments, making giant salamanders an ideal proxy-group for environmental and palaeoclimatic studies. The climate space of recent and fossil cryptobranchids is best characterized by high humidity with mean annual precipitation values over 900. mm. The recorded patchiness of their fossil record can be explained by habitat tracking and/or range expansion from higher altitudes into lowland settings during humid periods with increased basinal relief. In Central Asia cryptobranchids are recorded from five intervals, four of them are global warm periods: Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, Late Oligocene warming, Miocene Climate Optimum, and Mio-Pliocene transition. This distribution suggests that during global warmth the Asian cold high pressure zone during winter months may be weak or absent, thus moist westerly winds penetrate far into the continent. The presence of cryptobranchids also indicates that the aridification across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary as reported from Mongolia and northwestern China, does not occur in the Zaysan Basin, probably due to increased upslope precipitation in the rising Altai Mountains. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Previous studies of desert tortoise foraging ecology in the western Mojave Desert suggest that these animals are selective herbivores, which alter their diet according to the temporal availability of preferred food plants. These studies, however, did not estimate availability of potential food plants by taking into account the spatial and temporal variability in ephemeral plant abundance that occurs within the spring season. In this study, we observed 18 free-ranging adult tortoises take 35,388 bites during the spring foraging season. We also estimated the relative abundance of potential food plants by stratifying our sampling across different phenological periods of the 3-month long spring season and by different habitats and microhabitats. This methodology allowed us to conduct statistical tests comparing tortoise diet against plant abundance. Our results show that tortoises choose food plants non-randomly throughout the foraging season, a finding that corroborates the hypothesis that desert tortoises rely on key plants during different phenological periods of spring. Moreover, tortoises only consumed plants in a succulent state until the last few weeks of spring, at which time most annuals and herbaceous perennials had dried and most tortoises had ceased foraging. Many species of food plants--including several frequently eaten species--were not detected in our plant surveys, yet tortoises located these rare plants in their home ranges. Over 50{\%} of bites consumed were in the group of undetected species. Interestingly, tortoises focused heavily on several leguminous species, which could be nutritious foods owing to their presumably high nitrogen contents. We suggest that herbaceous perennials, which were rare on our study area but represented {\~{}}30{\%} of tortoise diet, may be important in sustaining tortoise populations during droughts when native annuals are absent. These findings highlight the vulnerability of desert tortoises to climate change if such changes alter the availability of their preferred food plants.},

Actual distribution of the characteristic in a random sample chosen from a population with normal distribution doesn't appear normal, especially when the sample size is small (Figure 1). Distributions of larger samples tend to resemble the distribution of the characteristic in the population better by taking on a bell-shaped curve when the values of a characteristic in the population are plotted against their frequency.},

Comparison with three other faunal assemblages underscores salient characteristics consisting of a high proportion of turtle and tortoise and an absence of pigs in the Lang Rongrien sample. Analysis of the faunal assemblage suggests that, in contrast to other sites such as Niah Cave and Moh Khiew that were occupied on a long-term basis, the Pleistocene levels of Lang Rongrien were intermittently occupied by foragers who may have been practicing a seasonal round that involved transhumance from interior to coast.

abstract = {At the end of the 19th century, after prolonged and extensive harvesting, indigenous giant tortoises had been eliminated from all islands in the Indian Ocean, except Aldabra atoll, where only a few survived. With greatly reduced levels of exploitation during the 20th century, the population recovered to a revised estimated total of 129,000 in 1973-1974, when the first sample census was conducted. A repeat census in 1997 revealed a highly significant reduction in numbers over the past 24 years to an estimated total of 100,000. The great majority of tortoises are still found at relatively high density in south-eastern Grande Terre, where the number of animals has declined by more than one-third. In contrast, low-density subpopulations on Malabar and Picard have almost doubled in size, but they represent less than 5{\%} of the total population. Corroborative evidence for the crash in the Grande Terre subpopulation comes from two independent observations: a significant increase in tortoise mortality; and a significant decline in tortoise counts on long-term population monitoring transects. These population changes are attributed to natural population regulatory mechanisms, exacerbated by low rainfall years in the period 1980-1997, including two consecutive years of below average rainfall in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997.},

abstract = {Research on the evolution of fully modern human cognitive capacities and cultural behaviors has flourished in recent years. Here, we focus on distinguishing between the two best-described models. The first hypothesizes a rapid, abrupt development of fully modern human behavior about 50,000 years ago (50 kya), at the transition from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) to the Later Stone Age (LSA) of Africa. The second proposes a gradual accumulation of advanced behavioral traits within the MSA (250-50 kya), ultimately coalescing in the LSA. The alternatives differ in the proposed relationship between population density and cultural change within the MSA, and this allows a test with the archaeological record of South Africa. In the Abrupt and Late Model, human population density in the MSA should be generally lower than in the LSA and there should be no trend towards higher population densities during the most recent MSA. In the Gradual Accumulation Model, human population densities should increase during the MSA, in keeping with the gradual or piecemeal development of advanced behaviors that presumably enhanced reproduction and survival. Past human population densities are impossible to calculate, but size changes in marine mollusks and tortoises can be used to track changes in density through time. This is because mollusks and tortoises grow continuously; they can be collected without special technology or risk; and human collectors tend to take the largest ones first, for reasons of visibility and food value. More intensive collection will thus reduce average mollusk or tortoise size, and during the stone age, the intensity of collection probably depended mainly on the number of collectors. A shift toward significantly smaller mollusks or tortoises thus implies larger, or at least denser,J human populations. Mollusk and tortoise size observations summarized here suggest that MSA populations tended to be less dense than LSA populations on the south and west coasts of South Africa, and the difference appears to owe more to culture than to environment, because the MSA and LSA localities represent a range of environments, scattered widely in time and space. The difference tentatively supports the Abrupt and Late Model. More conclusive support will require additional observations, particularly from early LSA sites, antedating 13 kya.},

abstract = {During recent years, our knowledge of fossil turtles from northern Greece has improved, as a result of both the discovery and description of new specimens and the revision of previously published material. The sites of Allatini and Pylea are among the classic Latest Miocene-Earliest Pliocene localities of northern Greece and have produced notable chelonian material. The purpose of this paper is to revise the previously published specimens from these sites and describe a new specimen of a turtle from Allatini. Taken together, these specimens constitute a diverse Macedonian chelonian assemblage, comprising a small tortoise, a large tortoise and a turtle. Our results augment previous knowledge of the composition of the Greek paleochelonofaunas in three main respects: first, they show that Testudo amiatae was not present in the Greek fossil record; second, they bring to light the earliest mention of a giant tortoise in Greece; finally, they provide the most ancient confirmed record of a fossil geoemydid in Greece.},

abstract = {A joint Dutch-Indonesian expedition to Celebes in 1970 worked especially in the Beru area whence the first described Pleistocene Celebes vertebrate remains came. In the present contribution I shall describe the most important specimens that have been brought to light. My thanks are due to Mr. R. P. Soejono for permission to take certain specimens with me to the Netherlands for study and comparison. The expedition was financed by the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (Wotro) at The Hague. No further remains of Elasmobranchii (sharks and sting rays: Hooijer, 1954b) were found at Sompoh, so there are no additions on that score. Of the giant land tortoise, originally described as Testudo margae Hooijer (1948), an abundance of material has been examined from Timor island (Hooijer, 1971). This has led to the conclusion that the fossil tortoise of Timor as well as that of Celebes are indistinguishable from Geochelone atlas (Falconer {\&} Cautley) from the Early Pleistocene of the Siwaliks of India and of Java. The distribution of this species from the south-east Asiatic continent beyond Wallace's Line to Celebes and Timor is the result of overseas dispersal. In the 1970 collection from Celebes there are two first neurals from Sompoh, 15/7/1970, and Marale, 17/7/1970, respectively, the proximal dylus siamensis Schneider, still extant in the Malay Archipelago (Java and Borneo), is represented not only by tooth and bone fragments from Beru, 14/7/1970, and Tjangkange, 1/8/1970, but also by coprolites, up to 35 mm in diameters, from Sompoh and Tjalio, 3/7/1970, 50 m terrace south of the road, in orange sand. end of a radius from Tjangkange, 1/8/1970, and shell fragments from},

abstract = {The three papers in this volume summarize the previous literature on fossil vertebrates from the Bahamas, provide revisions of the previously described fossil speci- mens, include identifications of newly collected material, and discuss changes in the late Pleistocene environment of the Bahaman archipelago. Olson and Pregill review the history of fossil exploration in the Bahamas, describe the known fossil localities, and briefly discuss the depauperate mammalian fauna. Pregill reviews the Pleistocene herpetofauna of New Providence Island, which is similar to that found on the island today, the only extinct taxa being a tortoise (Geochelone), a crocodile (Crocodylus), an iguana (Cyclura), and a gecko of the genus Aristelliger (previously misidentified as Tarentola). Taphonomy of the New Providence deposits and the zoogeographical patterns of the herpe- tofauna are discussed in relation to arid climatic conditions of the Wisconsinan glacial period. It is suggested that the establishment of a north-south rainfall gradient within the Bahamas has caused more extinctions in the wetter northern islands, whereas a more diverse herpetofauna persists in the drier southern islands. Olson and Hilgartner review the fossil record of birds from the Bahamas and propose the following changes in nomenclature: Calohierax quadratus = Buteo sp., Burhinus nanus = Burhinus bistriatus nanus, Glaucidium dickinsoni = Athene cunicularia, Otus providentiae = Athene cunicularia, Bathoceleus hyphalus = Melanerpes superciliaris, Corvus wetmorei = Corvus nasicus. About 50{\%} of the fossil avifauna of New Providence no longer occurs there and 40{\%} is extinct in the Bahamas. Species composition indicates that the Bahamas in the late Pleistocene were drier and had more open savanna-like and broadleaf scrub habitats. Subsequent increases in rainfall caused habitat changes that resulted in extinction. The implications of this for modern ecological theories are discussed.},

abstract = {The Dove Spring Formation (DSF; formerly the Ricardo Formation) is an 1800 m thick succession of fluvial, lacustrine, and volcanic rocks that contains a nearly continuous sequence of vertebrate fossil assemblages. The fossil faunas represent one of the most complete Clarendonian-age successions in North America, thus they provide key information for local and continental-wide correlations. Previous paleomagnetic, radioisotopic, and biochronologic work in the DSF yielded age correlations that have come under increased scrutiny from more recent studies in this and other similarly aged formations in California. Tephrochronological studies of volcanic horizons widely distributed across the Great Basin, including the DSF, yield additional geochronological information. The best fit combination of these studies provides for a revised temporal interpretation indicating that the DSF ranges from 12.5 Ma to about 8 Ma. A formerly proposed 0.7 million-year-long unconformity in Member 4 is no longer recognized. Although updated taxonomic studies on the carnivores, insectivores, rodents, horses, and antilocaprids of the DSF have resulted in significant modifications to earlier interpretations, renewed biostratigraphic analysis continues to recognize three superposed mammalian faunas. Characterization of these faunas reinforces conclusions regarding the provincial nature of the assemblages when compared with those of the Great Plains, and clearly marks the region as a discernable zoogeographic entity. Regional and continental comparisons of the faunas confirm a lower boundary for the Clarendonian at 12.5 Ma and a Clarendonian/Hemphillian boundary at 9.0 Ma. Composition of the youngest fauna in the DSF provides insight into the nature of the otherwise poorly represented earliest Hemphillian assemblages.},

At Middle and Late Pleistocene and Holocene localities in the Western Cape, people, scavengers, raptors and natural processes have contributed to assemblages of tortoises at several open-air sites. With the possible exception of Duinefontein 2, human use of tortoises in the earlier occurrences is masked by the effect of bush fires. As documented in a field study on the farm Elandsfontein Wes, bush fires introduce significant amounts of tortoise bone into the taphonomic stream. At Geelbek, the incidence of burnt bones near Later Stone Age fire places implies human activity.},

abstract = {The radiated tortoise, Geochelone radiata, one of Madagascar's four endemic tortoises, occupies a narrow band of xeric spiny forest along the island's southwest coast. Traditionally avoided by indigenous tribes, these tortoises are now routinely harvested for food. An accurate assessment of human exploitation remains problematic, however, hindered by limited, dated statistics available on tortoise populations. To update the radiated tortoise's status and distribution, we established a series of line transects at seven localities across its range and implemented a mark-recapture study at one of these localities (Cap Sainte Marie). Tortoises currently range from south of Tulear to east of Cap Sainte Marie, at density estimates spanning 27-5744 tortoises/km2. The mark-recapture estimate for Cap Sainte Marie (1905-2105 tortoises/km2) was substantially higher than its transect estimate (654 tortoises/km2) though comparable to actual tortoise captures (1438) there. Thus, our transect density values probably err as underestimates, and from these data, we calculate a conservative total population size of 12 million radiated tortoises. We also examined mitochondrial DNA sequences (ND4 gene) for two individuals/locality in a preliminary assessment of genetic variation across the species' range. Only two ND4 haplotypes were recovered, the more common haplotype representing 13 of the 14 individuals. We offer several conservation recommendations in light of our survey results. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However the rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach, means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity, evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record, and using species density estimates in management and conservation.},

abstract = {The evolution of species of giant tortoises and the nature of processes governing their dispersal in the Western Indian Ocean have been matters of interest for some time. Historical records indicate that these animals were once widely distributed in the region, from Madagascar to the Seychelles in the north and to the Mascarene islands in the south. New data on the status of Aldabrachelys and related or supposed species, and controversies regarding genetic diversity and distribution have prompted an evaluation of the islands and submerged Banks in the region that, during the later Cenozoic, might have provided refuges and/or stepping-stones for the spread of populations in what is now open ocean. Given the apparent stability of the crust in much of the area for at least the Quaternary Period, sea-level, driven by climatic change, and transport by ocean currents, appear to be the principle factors controlling the access not only of populations of giant tortoises but also other terrestrial biota to potential refuge areas in the region. The distributions of living and fossil tortoise communities are discussed. Four types of terrestrial oceanic refuges for migrants have been identified. At the present day, with the exception of Aldabra, high limestone islands offer only relatively small areas for colonization and all would have been drowned during interglacial sea-level high-stands. Although they have the potential for some increases in land area during the early stages of transitions to low-stand, as sea-level fell significantly they would have become waterless pinnacles, only generally accessible to organisms capable of flight. Volcanic islands have the same general limitations, but may have remained as smaller entities when sea-level was higher than at present, but providing only limited land access and restricted vegetation. Low islands and sand cays, typically of more recent origin, could not have existed during periods of high sea-levels, but many are situated on extensive submerged Banks that would have formed relatively large land areas when sea-level was low. Major Banks, most of which are regarded as fragments of continental crust, are currently submerged but, during glacial periods would together have offered land areas in excess of 130,000 km2, providing a diverse range of terrestrial environments and vegetation. Access to all of these was nevertheless restricted by the distribution of ocean currents, the only plausible natural means of dispersal, which probably varied during glacial interludes, but also by the abilities of the animals to survive long periods adrift in the ocean. The distribution of these tortoises, in both the fossil record and historical data, provides a model for the dispersal of other terrestrial biota in the region, although the present distribution and genetic characteristics of the tortoises probably reflects recent human intervention.},

In Mallorca, the Pliocene fauna was composed of the so-called Myotragus-fauna (mainly consisting of a bovid, a glirid and a soricid). In Menorca, it was constituted by the giant rabbit-fauna (mainly consisting of a giant rabbit and a tortoise), and in the Pityusics by a tortoise, a lizard and two rodents. A main faunal turnover took place during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene: the Myotragus-fauna reached Menorca and replaced the giant rabbit fauna. In the Pityusics, all mammals and the tortoise became extinct before the Late Pleistocene for unknown reasons, leaving birds and the lizard as the only vertebrates of these islands. Almost all the endemic vertebrates of the Balearics became extinct probably due to the first human arrival to the islands. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

These new remains, here referred to as the Capo Mannu D4 Local Fauna, are slightly younger in the sedimentary succession than the Local Fauna known in the literature as Mandriola and here re-named the Capo Mannu D1 Local Fauna. Vertebrates from Capo Mannu D4 include reptiles (Chelonii) and mammals (Bovidae and Suidae). The tortoise fossil shows peculiarities of shape that require the naming of a new species. The suid material includes a fragmentary palate and a partial mandible, referable to the endemic species Sus sondaari. Bovids are well represented in the assemblage, although quite fragmentary. They have been identified as belonging to at least two forms. One of these is comparable in morphology to Nesogoral, one of the most characteristic taxa of the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene Sardinian endemic fauna (the so called "Nesogoral complex"). On the whole, the Capo Mannu D4 assemblages open a new window on the Plio-Pleistocene terrestrial faunas of the Sardinian Island.},

abstract = {The most widely used evolutionary model for phylogenetic trees is the equal-rates Markov (ERM) model. A problem is that the ERM model predicts less imbalance than observed for trees inferred from real data; in fact, the observed imbalance tends to fall between the values predicted by the ERM model and those predicted by the proportional-to-distinguishable-arrangements (PDA) model. Here, a continuous multirate (MR) family of evolutionary models is presented which contains entire subfamilies corresponding to both the PDA and ERM models. Furthermore, this MR family covers an entire range from 'completely balanced' to 'completely unbalanced' models. In particular, the MR family contains other known evolutionary models. The MR family is very versatile and virtually free of assumptions on the character of evolution; yet it is highly susceptible to rigorous analyses. In particular, such analyses help to uncover adaptability, quasi-stabilization and prolonged stasis as major possible causes of the imbalance. However, the MR model is functionally simple and requires only three parameters to reproduce the observed imbalance.},

We continue to provide an updated comprehensive listing of important aspects of taxonomy, names, distribution, and conservation status of all turtles and tortoises of the world. We strive to record the most recent justified taxonomic assignment of terminal taxa in a hierarchical framework, providing annotations, including alternative possible arrangements, for some recently proposed changes. We provide com- mon English names and detailed distributional data for all taxa, listing occurrence by countries and many smaller political or geographic subunits (states or regions), including indications of native, extirpated, and introduced (modern or prehistoric) populations. We also include current published and draft IUCN Red List status determinations for all turtles, as well as CITES listings. The diversity of turtles and tortoises in the world that has existed in modern times (since 1500 AD), and currently generally recognized as distinct and included on this checklist, now consists of 331 species. Of these, 56 are polytypic, representing 121 additional recognized subspecies, or 452 total taxa of modern turtles and tortoises. Of these, 9 species and 2 subspecies, or 11 taxa (2.4{\%}), are extinct. As of the current IUCN 2012 Red List, 134 turtle species (58.8{\%} of 228 species listed, 40.5{\%} of all 331 recognized species) are officially regarded as globally Threatened (Critically Endangered [CR], Endangered [EN], or Vulnerable [VU]). We record additional draft Red List evaluations by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group (TFTSG) of the 103 previously “unevaluated” species, and updated draft re-evaluations of previously listed species, allowing us to evaluate the overall current threat levels for all turtles and tortoises. Of the 331 total species of turtles and tortoises, 101 (30.5{\%}) are CR or EN, 155 (46.8{\%}) are Threatened (CR, EN, or VU), and 164 (49.6{\%}) are Threatened or Extinct. If we provisionally adjust for predicted threat rates of Data Deficient species, then ca. 53{\%} of all turtles are Threatened. If we include Extinct species, and also adjust for Data Deficient species, then ca. 57{\%} of all modern turtles and tortoises are either already Extinct or Threatened. Turtles are among the most endangered of the major groups of vertebrates, surpassing birds, mammals, cartilaginous or bony fishes, and amphibians.},

abstract = {$\backslash$nAim$\backslash$nElevational gradients and land use changes can act together as drivers of species richness and composition. Responses to these drivers can be multidirectional, and resulting patterns of diversity might be unexpected or difficult to interpret. Present ecological relationships often reflect a legacy resulting from the influence of past geological, climatic and environmental changes on species dispersal, extinction and speciation. Here, we investigate amphibian diversity along altitudinal and disturbance gradients and evaluate how historical events may underlie contemporary distributional patterns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLocation$\backslash$nMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMethods$\backslash$nDuring two rainy seasons in 2011, we recorded anurans at 36 sites from the foothills to 3500 m altitude. A combination of multiple regression, ordination technique and cluster analysis were used to determine the effects of altitudinal changes and habitat modification on species richness and composition. Furthermore, we compared the anuran fauna of Mt. Kilimanjaro with other East African mountains by means of cluster analysis and analysed patterns of distributions with a special focus on montane forest species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$nSpecies richness declined with elevation and species assemblages were distinctly separated between lowland and highland altitudes. Presence of water bodies locally increased species richness, but we did not find significant correlations of species richness with other environmental variables. Mountains clustered into two major groups which reflected latitudinal position and differences in species distributions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMain conclusions$\backslash$nThis study highlights the importance of considering the geological history of a place especially when assessing the effects of anthropogenic disturbance. The young age of the volcano and the complex biogeographical processes which occurred in East Africa during the last 20 million years prevented most montane forest frogs from colonizing Mt. Kilimanjaro. Increasing aridification and land use changes may cause contraction of breeding sites with consequent local extinctions in the near future.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The taxonomy of giant Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) is currently based primarily on morphological characters and island of origin. Over the last decade, compelling genetic evidence has accumulated for multiple independent evolutionary lineages, spurring the need for taxonomic revision. On the island of Santa Cruz there is currently a single named species, C. porteri. Recent genetic and morphological studies have shown that, within this taxon, there are two evolutionarily and spatially distinct lineages on the western and eastern sectors of the island, known as the Reserva and Cerro Fatal populations, respectively. Analyses of DNA from natural populations and museum specimens, including the type specimen for C. porteri, confirm the genetic distinctiveness of these two lineages and support elevation of the Cerro Fatal tortoises to the rank of species. In this paper, we identify DNA characters that define this new species, and infer evolutionary relationships relative to other species of Galapagos tortoises.},

abstract = {Ecological suitability analysis aims to model the potential or probable distribution of species using environmental variables and available species occurrence information as predictors. Most of the European fossil Quaternary amphibians belong to extant species, and being physiologically ectothermic animals, their current ecological niches could become a reliable inference tool to infer past environmental conditions. However, this expectation has never been properly verified. The validity and accuracy of palaeoclimatic inferences based on batrachian species ranges is tested on the Iberian Peninsula, using both palaeofaunistic and Recent distribution data, and an updated database of georeferenced species occurrences is provided. The difficulties of using current geographic information to represent the full spectrum of environmental conditions at which a species occurs are critically examined. A palaeofaunistic review of the role played by historical factors as dispersal limitations for present amphibian species ranges is presented using the available phylogeographical scenarios. Virtual hypothetical taxa can be devised by considering the distributions of several species together and relating their known joint presences with the environmental conditions in these locations. Species distribution models based on these virtual taxa provide the best advisable inferential procedure. For direct raw inferences of the mutual climatic range method, contrary to expectations, the combined taxa sets do not increase their accuracy with the number of species included. This preliminary review shows that Iberian amphibian palaeoclimatic inferences are both valid and reliable enough, a sufficient approximation to complement other techniques. The precision, however, is quite variable among taxa, reflecting the effect of non-climatic distributional constraints.},

abstract = {This article analyzes and discusses the chronological and zoogeographic context of the Pliocene site of Kvabebi in order to shed light into the background of the early human occupation of Eurasia, as evidenced by the early Pleistocene site of Dmanisi. New paleontological and paleomagnetic research has allowed this site to be placed in a reverse interval which can be identified as chron 2An.1r. The age of this site is therefore close to 3.07 Ma, coeval to the Hadar beds of the Afar Depression and slightly older than the last hipparionine faunas in Europe, such as Villarroya in Spain. The fauna of Kvabebi is composed of a number of species common to Europe and Asia, but also includes others with African affinities, such as Kvabebihyrax kachethicus, Protoryx heinrichi, Parastrepsiceros sokolovi and Gazella postmitilinii. However, the presence these species cannot be explained as the result of a Pliocene dispersal from Africa, but rather as the last remnants of the so-called Greek-Iranian province. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, knowledge of human subsistence strategies relies on few data, given the shortage of study sites and the sparse anthropic evidence that has been recovered (Fosse and Bonifay, 1991; Fosse, 1994; Berm{\'{u}}dez de Castro et al., 1999; Gule{\c{c}} et al., 1999; Tappen et al., 2002; Echassoux, 2004; Gaudzinski, 2004; Huguet, 2007; Carbonell et al., 2008; Rabinovich et al., 2008; Espigares et al., 2010).

abstract = {1. In this study we used species accumulation models to solve one of the most serious problems encountered when comparing species richness between different communities. The problem is how to compare data among inventories in which different methodologies or measures of sampling effort have been employed. The methods used here for bats may be applied to any other biological group. We rt two asymptotic models to species accumulation curves for bat inventories to evaluate local or within-community diversity (alpha) and landscape diversity (gamma) in central Veracruz, Mexico. 2. Species accumulation models allow us to: (i) measure within-inventory effcacy and completeness; (ii) obtain an estimate of species richness that is based on a standardized measure of sampling effort, which makes valid comparisons between inventories possible; and (iii) estimate the minimum sampling effort required to reach a satisfactory level of completeness. 3. The applied models rt well in all cases (r2 {\textgreater} 0'95). The linear dependence model predicted lower asymptotes and the Clench model predicted higher asymptotes than the observed species richness. These models are useful as predictors representing the lower and upper limits between which the true species richness value should lie. 4. Alpha diversity for bats in all vegetation communities (11�18 species) was lower than the gamma diversity (20 species), suggesting that species richness and the sampling e{\_}ort required are related to environmental heterogeneity. 5. We propose that 90{\%} of the total fauna predicted by either of the models is an acceptable standardized value for comparing species richness between communities. 6. We assessed the within-inventory completeness as the proportion of the models' asymptote, where 90{\%} is the desired minimum level of completeness. Except in palm stands, all bat inventories had an acceptable level of completeness, at least for the linear dependence model. 7. For conditions similar to those of our study area, the minimum e{\_}ort required to obtain a satisfactory level of completeness is 5�18 nights for plant communities and 18 nights for more heterogeneous landscapes. 8. We make recommendations for improving the e{\_}cacy and completeness of bat surveys based on the application of species accumulation models.},

abstract = {The Early to Middle Miocene fossil locality Sandelzhausen has yielded 48 species of ectothermic vertebrates and thus represents one of the most diverse ectotherm faunas of Miocene age. Thirty-five taxa of fishes, amphibians and reptiles, including three new species: Pelobates fahlbuschi nov. sp. (Pelobatidae, the most abundant vertebrate), Tropidophorus bavaricus nov. sp. (Lygosominae) and Bavaricordylus molassicus nov. sp. (Cordylidae), are described. Three additional species are new, but are not named yet: Ranidae indet. nov. gen. et sp., Anguidae gen. indet. sp. nov. and Palaeoblanus sp. nov. (Amphisbaenidae). In order to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment and past hydrologic conditions, a new methodology (the tooth replacement method, TRM) is introduced, which allows for the detection of autochthonous components within freshwater fish taphocoenose. TRM is tested on 45 localities from the Upper Freshwater Molasse and gives reasonable results in agreement with other analytical approaches. It is therefore viewed as a reliable method to distinguish perennial from seasonal water conditions at the Sandelzhausen locality. Using the TRM it was demonstrated that the palaeohydrology of Sandelzhausen is characterized by a change from temporary water to permanent water conditions. During the period of temporary water conditions (units B to D1, lower part) the ecosystem was driven by seasonal inundations, and the remaining riparian pools have yielded no autochthonous fish population, but acted as spawning places for amphibians (amphibian pool). A mostly open habitat in the close vicinity, with sandy and non-groundwater-affected soils during the dry season, is suggested based on the absolute dominance of the spade- foot Pelobates fahlbuschi nov. sp. This ecosystem changed up-section (late part of unit D1 and during D2 and E) due to the establishment of permanent water conditions of riparian pond type, preserving an autochthonous Palaeocarassius/Channa fish population (fish pond). The reconstructed precipitation values suggest that the observed change in hydrologic conditions was probably driven by climate. The lower part of the section gives semi-arid/subhumid values, with 571 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP), whereas the upper part yields sub-humid/humid values of 847 mm MAP. The increase in precipitation by about 280 mm was perhaps caused by a less seasonal precipitation regime with concomitant higher regional groundwater tables during units D2 and E. Based on the occurrence of several thermophilous reptile species, and in agreement with palaeobotanical and oxygen isotope data, the climate of Sandelzhausen is interpreted as subtropical with mean annual temperatures from 18°C to 20.8°C, mean cold month temperatures from 12.6°C to 13.3°C and mean warm month temperatures from 25.1°C to 28.1°C.},

abstract = {The preliminary results of the analysis of fossil vertebrate remains from 19 fissure fillings in the karst network at Monte Tuttavista (Orosei, Nuoro) are reported. About 80 taxa, among fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals have been recognised. These remains document the evolution of vertebrate assemblages in the Sardinian insular domain, during a time interval apparently spanning the Late Pliocene to Late Pleistocene or Holocene. A succession of at least four populating complexes has been identified which document the vertebrate colonisation phases from the Italian mainland and the following periods of insularity. Indeed, the occurrence of endemic taxa such as the murid Rhagapodemus minor, the primate Macaca cf. M. majori and the caprine Nesogoral, suggest some fissure fillings date to a phase close to the Plio/Pleistocene boundary since these taxa occur at the Sardinian locality Capo Figari I which has been dated to about 1.8 Ma. However, the presence of the "hunting-hyaena" Chasmaporthetes, never reported before in Sardinia, could suggest that the beginning of the vertebrate record of Monte Tuttavista is older, given that this carnivore is documented in European Middle Pliocene-Early Pleistocene localities. The vertebrate assemblages that document the most recent migratory phases in the karst network of Monte Tuttavista are characterised by the occurrence of the endemic megalocerine cervid Praemegaceros cazioti and the arvicolid Tyrrhenicola henseli which are comparable with those occurring in other Late Pleistocene and early Holocene Sardinian sites.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Knowledge about dietary niche is key to understanding hominin evolution, since diet influences body proportions, brain size, cognition, and habitat preference. In this study we provide ecological context for the current debate on modernity (or not) of aquatic resource exploitation by hominins. We use the Homo erectus site of Trinil as a case study to investigate how research questions on possible dietary relevance of aquatic environments can be addressed. Faunal and geochemical analysis of aquatic fossils from Trinil Hauptknochenschicht (HK) fauna demonstrate that Trinil at ∼1.5 Ma contained near-coastal rivers, lakes, swamp forests, lagoons, and marshes with minor marine influence, laterally grading into grasslands. Trinil HK environments yielded at least eleven edible mollusc species and four edible fish species that could be procured with no or minimal technology. We demonstrate that, from an ecological point of view, the default assumption should be that omnivorous hominins in coastal habitats with catchable aquatic fauna could have consumed aquatic resources. The hypothesis of aquatic exploitation can be tested with taphonomic analysis of aquatic fossils associated with hominin fossils. We show that midden-like characteristics of large bivalve shell assemblages containing Pseudodon and Elongaria from Trinil HK indicate deliberate collection by a selective agent, possibly hominin. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Gorham's Cave is located in the British territory of Gibraltar in the southernmost end of the Iberian Peninsula. Recent excavations, which began in 1997, have exposed an 18 m archaeological sequence that covered the last evidence of Neanderthal occupation and the first evidence of modern human occupation in the cave. By applying the Mutual Climatic Range method on the amphibian and reptile assemblages, we propose here new quantitative data on the terrestrial climatic conditions throughout the latest Pleistocene sequence of Gorham's Cave. In comparison with current climatic data, all mean annual temperatures were about 1.6-1.8 ??C lower in this region. Winters were colder and summers were similar to today. Mean annual precipitation was slightly lower, but according to the Aridity Index of Gaussen there were only four dry months during the latest Pleistocene as opposed to five dry months today during the summer. The climate was Mediterranean and semi-arid (according to the Aridity Index of Dantin-Revenga) or semi-humid (according to the Aridity Index of Martonne). The atmospheric temperature range was higher during the latest Pleistocene, mainly due to lower winter temperatures. Such data support recent bioclimatic models, which indicate that high rainfall levels may have been a significant factor in the late survival of Neanderthal populations in southern Iberia. The Solutrean levels of Gorham's Cave and climate records from cores in the Alboran Sea indicate increasing aridity from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3-2. Because Neanderthals seem to have been associated with woodland habitats, we propose that lessening rainfall may have caused the degradation of large areas of forest and may have made late surviving Neanderthal populations more vulnerable outside southern refuges like the Rock of Gibraltar. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The average body size of brachiopods from a single habitat type increased gradually by more than two orders of magnitude during their initial Cambrian-Devonian radiation. This increase occurred nearly in parallel across all major brachiopod clades (classes and orders) and is consistent with Cope's rule: the tendency for size to increase over geological time. The increase is not observed within small, constituent clades (represented here by families), which underwent random, unbiased size changes. This scale-dependence is caused by the preferential origination of new families possessing initially larger body sizes. However, this increased family body size does not confer advantages in terms of greater geological duration or genus richness over families possessing smaller body sizes. We suggest that the combination of size-biased origination of families and parallel size increases among major, more inclusive brachiopod clades from a single habitat type is best explained by long-term, secular environmental changes during the Paleozoic that provided opportunities for body size increases associated with major morphological evolution.},

abstract = {The Bolson tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus) is the first species of extirpated megafauna to be repatriated into the United States. In September 2006, 30 individuals were translocated from Arizona to New Mexico with the long-term objective of restoring wild populations via captive propagation. We evaluated mtDNA sequences and allelic diversity among 11 microsatellite loci from the captive population and archived samples collected from wild individuals in Durango, Mexico (n = 28). Both populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and the captive population captured roughly 97.5{\%} of the total wild diversity, making it a promising founder population. Genetic screening of other captive animals (n = 26) potentially suitable for reintroduction uncovered multiple hybrid G. flavomarginatus×G. polyphemus, which were ineligible for repatriation; only three of these individuals were verified as purebred G. flavomarginatus. We used these genetic data to inform mate pairing, reduce the potential for inbreeding and to monitor the maintenance of genetic diversity in the captive population. After six years of successful propagation, we analyzed the parentage of 241 hatchlings to assess the maintenance of genetic diversity. Not all adults contributed equally to successive generations. Most yearly cohorts of hatchlings failed to capture the diversity of the parental population. However, overlapping generations of tortoises helped to alleviate genetic loss because the entire six-year cohort of hatchlings contained the allelic diversity of the parental population. Polyandry and sperm storage occurred in the captives and future management strategies must consider such events.},

abstract = {Fossil evidence of extant amphibian and reptile species is relatively well documented in the Pleistocene record. However, the early Pliocene records of extant species are much more scarce and their Miocene (or even the early Miocene) records are extremely rare. The late Pliocene Central European assemblages contain several extinct forms that survived from the late Miocene. The extinction event at the early/late Pliocene boundary (MN 15/MN 16) distinctively affected especially the southern part of Central Europe (the last occurrences of Albanerpeton pannonicus, Mertensiella mera, and Latonia gigantea). Several other taxa died out during MN 16 zone. This Pliocene extinction is a result of deterioration of climatic conditions with the process of aridization playing, most probably, the key role. Because numerous taxa became extinct long before the beginning of the Pleistocene during the MN 15 and MN 16 zones, the Pliocene/Pleistocene transition (c. 1.8 Ma) is not reflected in the evolution of Central European herpetological assemblages. Herpetological assemblages fundamentally changed during the terminal part of the early Biharian (early Pleistocene) when several Pliocene and early Biharian representatives became extinct. In the late Biharian herpetological assemblages no extant "Mediterranean" taxa have been reported from Central European localities situated north of Austria. "Mediterranean" amphibian and reptile species which receded to refugia in the Balkan Peninsula during the first late Biharian cold cycles were unable to recolonize the wide areas of Europe during the intensive but short warm climatic cycles.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that restoration ecologists should be most concerned with restoring species interactions rather than species diversity per se [1]. Rewilding with taxon substitutes, the intentional introduction of exotic species to replace the ecosystem functions of recently extinct species, is one way to reverse ecosystem dysfunction following the loss of species interactions [2]. This is highly controversial [3], in part because of a lack of rigorous scientific studies [4]. Here we present the first empirical evidence of an in situ rewilding project undertaken as a hypothesis-driven ecosystem management option. On Ile aux Aigrettes, a 25-hectare island off Mauritius, the critically endangered large-fruited endemic ebony, Diospyros egrettarum (Ebenaceae), was seed-dispersal limited after the extinction of all native large-bodied frugivores, including giant tortoises. We introduced exotic Aldabra giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea, to disperse the ebony seeds. Not only did the tortoises ingest the large fruits and disperse substantial numbers of ebony seeds, but tortoise gut passage also improved seed germination, leading to the widespread, successful establishment of new ebony seedlings. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of these exotic frugivores is aiding the recovery of ebonies. We argue for more reversible rewilding experiments to investigate whether extinct species interactions can be restored. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hunt2008a,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The problem of gradual versus punctuated change within phyletic lineages can be understood in terms of the homogeneity of evolutionary dynamics. Hypotheses of punctuated change imply that the rules governing evolutionary change shift over time such that the normal dynamics of stasis are temporarily suspended, permitting a period of net evolutionary change. Such explanations are members of a larger class of models in which evolutionary dynamics are in some way heterogeneous over time. In this paper, I develop a likelihood-based statistical framework to evaluate the support for this kind of evolutionary model. This approach divides evolutionary sequences into nonoverlapping segments, each of which is fit to a separate evolutionary model. Models with heterogeneous dynamics are generally more complex—they require more parameters to specify—than uniform evolutionary models such as random walks and stasis. The Akaike Information Criterion can be used to judge whether the greater complexity of punctuational models is offset by a sufficient gain in log-likelihood for these models to be preferred.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Two main migration events of thermophilic ectotherms at 20 Ma and 18 Ma in the Lower Miocene are discerned. They indicate the beginning of the Miocene Climatic Optimum in Central Europe (42-45°N palaeolatitude) with a lower limit of the mean annual temperature (MAT) of 17.4°C derived from the minimal MAT of their extant relatives. Furthermore, additional palaeobotanical data and records of bauxite point to a MAT of 22°C. This warm and humid optimum peaked at 18-16.5 Ma (Ottnangian, Karpatian), and is confirmed by the coexistence of all investigated thermophilic taxa. The following period (Early Badenian) is characterised by probably unchanged temperatures but a seasonality in precipitation with dry periods up to six months. Two major seasonal phases between 16.3 and ∼15.7 Ma (earliest Early Badenian) and between 14.7 and ∼14.5 Ma (Early/Middle Badenian transition) are indicated by an immigration of dry adapted taxa from the surrounding karst plateau to the NAFB. It is presumed that the tectonical reorganisation of the Central Paratethys realm had considerable influence on this regional humidity pattern. The warm period ended abruptly between 14.0 and 13.5 Ma (Middle/Late Badenian transition) with major regional extinction events of most of the thermophilic groups in Central Europe and a drop of the MAT of probably more than 7°C to temperatures around 14.8-15.7°C. This drop can be attributed predominantly to a decrease of more than 11°C of the minimum cold months temperature. This temperature decrease marked the beginning of a climatic zonation of the European continent and is also evidenced by a progressively southward disappearance of the crocodile Diplocynodon from 38-45°N palaeolatitude to 30-37°N during the Middle and earliest Late Miocene. The results correlate well with palaeobotanical data from the mid-latitudes of Europe and North America, and the deep-sea temperature curve generated from oxygen isotope ratios. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The Early to Middle Miocene Fluviatile Untere Serie lithostratigraphic unit of the Upper Freshwater Molasse (UFM) in the North Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB) crops out in a 40 m long section at Untereichen-Altenstadt (central part of the NAFB). This section yields a unique superposition of two vertebrate assemblages belonging to different biostratigraphic units: early part OSM C + D (Karpatian) and OSM E (Early Badenian). Detailed taxonomic analyses reveal different diversity patterns in the two assemblages. Nine small mammal and six ectothermic vertebrate taxa occur in the older level UA 540 m, while 20 small mammal and 23 ectothermic vertebrate taxa are recorded for the younger level UA 565 m. From the latter locality comes a small-sized representative of the biostratigraphically significant Megacricetodon lappi lineage. This evolutionary level has not been documented previously for the eastern part of the NAFB. Bioclimatic analysis combined with lithofacies and architectural element analysis indicates that significant changes in the fluvial sedimentation style, surface-water runoff and tectonics occurred between the Early Karpatian and Early Badenian. A meandering fluvial system (marly unit) is erosively overlain by sandy braided river deposits (sandy unit). Overbank deposits of the marly unit revealed that the older vertebrate fossil assemblage (UA 540 m) is deposited in an animal burrow that was presumably produced by owls. Both reptilian and mammalian taxa are indicative of a relatively open environment and dry, probably semi-arid climate. Conversely, vertebrates from the sandy unit (UA 565 m), which are accumulated in channel fill deposits, suggest closed as well as open habitats with a subtropical humid climate and mean annual rainfall of about 1,000 mm. According to the sequence stratigraphic analysis the marly unit is interpreted as a highstand-system-tract of the TB 2.2 global 3rd order sequence. The new results add support to the hypothesis that the erosional unconformity between both sedimentary units spanning the Karpatian-Badenian transition corresponds to the pre-Riesian hiatus, which has been interpreted as part of the Styrian Tectonic Phase, and was previously identified only in the eastern and northeastern part of the NAFB. The biostratigraphic data further indicate that this hiatus lasted longer in the eastern than in the central part of the basin.},

abstract = {Background: The largest living lizard species, Varanus komodoensis Ouwens 1912, is vulnerable to extinction, being restricted to a few isolated islands in eastern Indonesia, between Java and Australia, where it is the dominant terrestrial carnivore. Understanding how large-bodied varanids responded to past environmental change underpins long-term management of V. komodoensis populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We reconstruct the palaeobiogeography of Neogene giant varanids and identify a new (unnamed) species from the island of Timor. Our data reject the long-held perception that V. komodoensis became a giant because of insular evolution or as a specialist hunter of pygmy Stegodon. Phyletic giantism, coupled with a westward dispersal from mainland Australia, provides the most parsimonious explanation for the palaeodistribution of V. komodoensis and the newly identified species of giant varanid from Timor. Pliocene giant varanid fossils from Australia are morphologically referable to V. komodoensis suggesting an ultimate origin for V. komodoensis on mainland Australia (.3.8 million years ago). Varanus komodoensis body size has remained stable over the last 900,000 years (ka) on Flores, a time marked by major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island's megafauna, the arrival of early hominids by 880 ka, co-existence with Homo floresiensis, and the arrival of modern humans by 10 ka. Within the last 2000 years their populations have contracted severely. Conclusions/Significance: Giant varanids were once a ubiquitous part of Subcontinental Eurasian and Australasian faunas during the Neogene. Extinction played a pivotal role in the reduction of their ranges and diversity throughout the late Quaternary, leaving only V. komodoensis as an isolated long-term survivor. The events over the last two millennia now threaten its future survival.},

abstract = {Fossil eggshells from the Late Miocene Uru- maco Formation of north-western Venezuela are reported. Stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine shell gross morphology and ultrastructure, respectively. Diagnostic turtle features in the eggshells include a distinct pattern of crystal aggregations within the shell units. The eggs had an elliptical shape with a maxi- mum diameter of c.56,5 mm and width of c.43,5 mm, as measured in a specimen preserving the egg's outline. Scat- tered clutches of broken eggshells were found embedded in one horizon of a coarse, sandy sediment, with grains not well sorted containing foraminifera and fragments of bivalve shells. The sediments are rich in ichnofossils and the reddish colour of the sandstone indicates an oxidizing environment. These facts suggest that the eggs were depos- ited in a beach directly facing the sea or brackish waters, perhaps near a river delta or lagoon, as is typical of the Urumaco sequence. In the same stratigraphical layer and next to one of the egg clusters, a carapace assignable to the pelomedusoid Bairdemys venezuelensis was found, sug- gesting that this species was a colonial nester that laid its eggs in beaches and lived in a marine or nearshore marine environment.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim The island rule describes a trend toward dwarfism of large animals and gigantism of small animals on islands. Studies of vertebrates, including reptiles, report conflicting results regarding the generality of this evolutionary pattern.We studied the size evolution of insular turtles at the intra- and interspecific levels, as well as the clade level.We examined the evolutionary patterns, the relationship of habitat preferences and insular turtle size and whether the island rule extends to turtles. Location Islands world-wide and adjacent continents. Methods We collected data from the literature and expanded our database by measuring turtle specimens in museum collections. We used reduced major axis regression to test the island rule at the inter- and intraspecific levels, after account- ing for phylogenetic effects. In addition, we compared body size frequency distri- butions of insular versus mainland turtles at the clade level. Results Our analyses revealed no support for the island rule in turtles. Intraspecifically, we found no systematic pattern of body size evolution. Interspecifically, large turtle species tend to become larger on islands, in contrast to the island rule predictions. Islands generally harbour larger turtles than mainland regions. This pattern is especially apparent when recently extinct species are con- sidered.We found no impact of habitat preferences on the evolution of body size on islands. Main conclusions Turtles on islands do not follow the island rule.We suggest that both physiological and ecological factors drive turtle body size evolution on islands, and their tendency for insular gigantism. Large turtles can survive longer periods of water or food shortage on small oceanic islands. Increased intraspecific competition and reduced interspecific competition and predation on islands may favour large body size.A non-mutually exclusive explanation is that the presence of giant tortoises on islands may reflect founder effects rather than evolution – large turtles are better island colonizers.

abstract = {ABSTRACTA new genus, Taraschelon, is proposed here for the largest tortoise known in the European Paleogene record. Its type and only known species, ?Testudo? gigas, was described in the first half of the 19th century. It comes from the French locality of Bournoncle-Saint-Pierre, in Auvergne (Haute-Loire). Extremely limited and partially incorrect information about this species has hitherto been available. Detailed study confirms the validity of this species and for the first time allows for a diagnosis. Taraschelon is the first genus of tortoise identified in the European Oligocene record, and one of the few genera known from the Paleogene of this continent. Comparison of Taraschelon with other primitive European forms shows an important diversity of Testudinidae in the Paleogene of this continent.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:EC5F5D27-243C-4C33-A99E-98B5762267A1Citation for this article: P{\'{e}}rez-Garc{\'{i}}a, A. 2015.

abstract = {Species-area relationships (SARs) are one of the fundamental patterns in ecology. However, how the way they were constructed influences resulting SAR shapes has gained astonishingly little attention. We use data of the distribution atlas of Polish butterflies to compare SARs constructed from four different designs: adding up species numbers of independent areas (species accumulation curves using contiguous and non-contiguous areas), using a nested design, and comparing species numbers of independent areas of different sizes. It appeared that the way of constructing SARs influences the outcome. We attribute this influence to the pronounced faunal dissimilarities of more distant areas (spatial species turnover). The nested design resulted in significantly higher slopes and lower intercepts of power function SARs than the other designs. SARs from all four sampling designs showed a pronounced downward curvature on small spatial scales. Only the nested design predicted species densities correctly. The implications of these results for the use of SARs in bioconservation are discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract: During the last few years the Portuguese paleoherpetofauna has become evident mainly through its most charismatic group, the dinosaurs. The recent discoveries in Portugal of several dinosaur remnants, inclu-ding bones, eggs, embryos, gastroliths and tracks, has deserved considerable newspaper coverage, and has been timely followed by a strong divulgation compaign, promoted by the National Museum of Natural History of Lisbon, headed by the geologist, Prof. Galopim de Carvalho. The extended, and sometimes controversial, ac-tions of public and political sensibilization undertaken in order to preserve many of the sites where the remains were found, have contributed to sustain, and even to increase, the interest in that group of big reptiles. Neverless, the importance of the Portuguese paleoherpetofauna is by no means limited to dinosaurs! In Portugal there are remains of many other reptiles and amphibians since the early Mesozoic – Turtles, Cro-codiles, Icthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Pterosaurs, Lepidosaurs, " Stegocephalians " and Lissamphibia – which though generally less known, have great evolutionary, paleogeographic and paleoclimatic importance. Many Portuguese and foreign researchers were involved in their discovery and study, since the last century. Among these, the names of Georges Zbyszewski, Miguel Telles Antunes, Veiga Ferreira, H. Sauvage, A.F. Lap-parent, L. Ginsburg, R.Thulborn, P. Galton, stand out. Many of these studies are nevertheless dispersed through an ample array of publications, in which the references to the reptiles and amphibians, frequently, either appear as a side issue or are presented in a broader zoological context. This has caused them to pass pratically unnoti-ced by the majority of the researchers devoted to the study of our present herpetofauna. Because of this situation we engaged to gather all the available informations concerning the Portuguese pa-leoherpetofauna to make easier their divulgation and, consequently, to stimulate the interest in the study of our past reptiles and amphibians. In this work we report the main Portuguese paleoherpetological findings, with se-veral comments about their morphological and ecological features.},

abstract = {The fossil record of the turtle clade Baenidae ranges from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) to the Eocene. The group is present throughout North America during the Early Cretaceous, but is restricted to the western portions of the continents in the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. No credible remains of the clade have been reported outside of North America to date. Baenids were warm-adapted freshwater aquatic turtles that supported high levels of diversity at times through niche partitioning, particularly by adapting to a broad range of dietary preferences ranging from omnivorous to molluscivorous. Current phylogenies place Baenidae near the split of crown-group Testudines. Within Baenidae three more indusive, named clades are recognized: Baenodda, Palatobaeninae and Eubaeninae. A taxonomic review of the group concludes that of 49 named taxa, 30 are nomina valida, 12 are nomina invalida and 7 are nomina dubia.},

abstract = {Over-grazing or browsing by large herbivores may result in the loss of individual plant species or entire plant communities. Restoration schemes often involve exclusion of large mammals, but the resulting changes in vegetation may alter other important ecological processes such as regeneration, via changes in microsite availability for seed germination or increases in populations of seedling predators. Working within a large fenced area from which large mammals were excluded, we experimentally tested the effects of microsite, small herbivores, and their interactions on post-dispersal seed and early seedling mortality of one nationally scarce (Salix arbuscula) and one nationally rare (S. lapponum) species of montane willow. Seeds were sown in three different microsites: natural vegetation, mown vegetation (mimicking grazed sward), and bare ground. Small exclosures and slug pellets were used to examine the effects of small mammal and slug predation, respectively. Survival of seedlings was monitored during the summer following planting. The presence of bare ground, rather than the absence of herbivores, was of over-riding importance for early seedling survival and establishment. Protecting seedlings from small mammals made no difference to the levels of survival; however, protecting seedlings from slugs (Arion spp.) resulted in approximately 45{\%} of seedlings surviving until the end of the summer compared to only 30{\%} when seedlings were available to slugs. Although excluding large herbivores may increase seed production of existing individuals, the impacts of changes to plant communities on processes such as regeneration need to be considered if restoration projects are to be fully successful.},

abstract = {Of all of the sources of evidence for evolution by natural selection, perhaps the most problematic for Darwin was the geological record of organic change. In response to the absence of species-level transformations in the fossil record, Darwin argued that the fossil record was too incomplete, too biased, and too poorly known to provide strong evidence against his theory. Here, this view of the fossil record is evaluated in light of 150 years of subsequent paleontological research. Although Darwin's assessment of the completeness and resolution of fossiliferous rocks was in several ways astute, today the fossil record is much better explored, documented, and understood than it was in 1859. In particular, a reasonably large set of studies tracing evolutionary trajectories within species can now be brought to bear on Darwin's expectation of gradual change driven by natural selection. An unusually high-resolution sequence of stickleback-bearing strata records the transformation of this lineage via natural selection. This adaptive trajectory is qualitatively consistent with Darwin's prediction, but it occurred much more rapidly than he would have guessed: almost all of the directional change was completed within 1,000 generations. In most geological sequences, this change would be too rapid to resolve. The accumulated fossil record at more typical paleontological scales (10(4)-10(6) years) reveals evolutionary changes that are rarely directional and net rates of change that are perhaps surprisingly slow, two findings that are in agreement with the punctuated-equilibrium model. Finally, Darwin's view of the broader history of life is reviewed briefly, with a focus on competition-mediated extinction and recent paleontological and phylogenetic attempts to assess diversity dependence in evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Insular giant tortoise diversity has been depleted by Late Quaternary extinctions, but the taxonomic status of many extinct populations remains poorly understood due to limited available fossil or subfossil material, hindering our ability to reconstruct Quaternary island biotas and environments. Giant tortoises are absent from current-day insular Caribbean ecosystems, but tortoise remains from Quaternary deposits indicate the former widespread occurrence of these animals across the northern Caribbean. We report new Quaternary giant tortoise material from several cave sites in Pedernales Province, southern Dominican Republic, Hispaniola, representing at least seven individuals, which we describe as Chelonoidis marcanoi sp. nov. Although giant tortoise material was first reported from the Quaternary record of Hispaniola almost 35 years ago, tortoises are absent from most Quaternary deposits on the island, which has been studied extensively over the past century. The surprising abundance of giant tortoise remains in both vertical and horizontal caves in Hispaniola's semi-arid ecoregion may indicate that this species was adapted to open dry habitats and became restricted to a habitat refugium in southeastern Hispaniola following climatic-driven environmental change at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Hispaniola's dry forest ecosystem may therefore have been shaped by giant tortoises for much of its evolutionary history.},

abstract = {The evolution of blanid amphisbaenians (Mediterranean worm lizards) is mainly inferred based on molecular studies, despite their fossils are common in Cenozoic European localities. This is because the fossil record exclusively consists in isolated elements of limited taxonomic value. We describe the only known fossil amphisbaenian skull from Europe - attributed to Blanus mendezi sp. nov. (Amphisbaenia, Blanidae) - which represents the most informative fossil blanid material ever described. This specimen, from the Middle Miocene of Abocador de Can Mata (11.6 Ma, MN7+8) in the Vall{\`{e}}s-Pened{\`{e}}s Basin (Catalonia, NE Iberian Peninsula), unambiguously asserts the presence of Blanus in the Miocene of Europe. This reinforces the referral to this genus of the previously-known, much more incomplete and poorly-diagnostic material from other localities of the European Neogene. Our analysis - integrating the available molecular, paleontological and biogeographic data - suggests that the new species postdates the divergence between the two main (Eastern and Western Mediterranean) extant clades of blanids, and probably precedes the split between the Iberian and North-Western African subclades. This supports previous paleobiogeographic scenarios for blanid evolution and provides a significant minimum divergence time for calibrating molecular analyses of blanid phylogeny.},

In collaboration with the Kayapo´ Indians of A'Ukre of southeastern Amazonia, we obtained a game harvest proﬁle of over 1360 forest vertebrates consumed at this village over a 20-month period, including 743 mammals, 361 forest tortoises and 256 birds from a minimum of 42 game species. This amounted to a total of 13,775 kg of game animals harvested over the entire study (mean = 26.2 kg d-1). We also obtained some 450 km of line transect census data of midsized to large-bodied vertebrates within the core hunting catchment of this village and in an unhunted but otherwise comparable site upriver of A'Ukre. Population density estimates of 16 of the 18 species censused were signiﬁcantly depressed by hunting by central place foragers within the village catchment, and a number of harvest-sensitive prey species showed clear evidence of local depletion. For the time being, however, we can conclude that hunting was sustainable at the landscape scale largely because source-sink dynamics in the context of low village catchment density is made possible by large surrounding tracts of primary forest that remain unharvested or underharvested.},

abstract = {The “Sima del Elefante” (TE site) (Atapuerca, Spain) is a major cave infill with a stratigraphic succes- sion 25 m thick and 15 m wide, wealthy in animal bones and evidences of human occupation at different Pleistocene ages. TE site is under systematic excavation since 1996, and the inferior and superior levels are being dug up independently. The exposed section has been divided into 21 lito-stratigraphic units defined by major unconformities. Concerning the cave history, at least three main infill phases have been identified. The lower phase (TE8-TE14) is dated to Early Pleistocene (between 1.1 and 1.4 million years ago) on the basis of inverse paleomagnetics and belonging to the later Early Pleistocene on the basis of biochronology. The TE lower phase is providing a rich faunal assemblage, and shows evidence of human occupation. A set of stone tools of flint, and possibly, calcareous, is being found at these lev- els. Hence, the lower part of the TE section documents early presence of hominids in Europe and consti- tuted an important element in the understanding of human dispersions out-of-Africa. The middle phase (TE15-TE19) dated to Middle Pleistocene and it is further sud-divided into a basal part (TE15-TE17), still largely unexplored, but no vertebrate fossil record is present at this levels. Units TE18, and mainly TE19 unit, date to late Middle Pleistocene, and contain an abundant record of large mammals as well as stone tools included in calcareous breccias. The TE19 G level contains abundant pieces of charcoal, though verification of its antropic character is pending.

abstract = {We examined the phylogeography and history of giant Galapagos tortoise populations based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 161 individuals from 21 sampling sites representing the 11 currently recognized extant taxa. Molecular clock and geological considerations indicate a founding of the monophyletic Galapagos lineage around 2-3 million years ago, which would allow for all the diversification to have occurred on extant islands. Founding events generally occurred from geologically older to younger islands with some islands colonized more than once. Six of the 11 named taxa can be associated with monophyletic maternal lineages. One, Geochelone porteri on Santa Cruz Island, consists of two distinct populations connected by the deepest node in the archipelago-wide phylogeny, whereas tortoises in northwest Santa Cruz are closely related to those on adjacent Pinzon Island. Volcan Wolf, the northernmost volcano of Isabela Island, consists of both a unique set of maternal lineages and recent migrants from other islands, indicating multiple colonizations possibly due to human transport or multiple colonization and partial elimination through competition. These genetic findings are consistent with the mixed morphology of tortoises on this volcano. No clear genetic differentiation between two taxa on the two southernmost volcanoes of Isabela was evident. Extinction of crucial populations by human activities confounds whether domed versus saddleback carapaces of different populations are mono- or polyphyletic. Our findings revealed a complex phylogeography and history for this tortoise radiation within an insular environment and have implications for efforts to conserve these endangered biological treasures.},

Successful tortoise conservation efforts have focused on species recovery, but ecosystem conservation and restoration requires a better understanding of the wider ecological consequences of this drastic reduction in the archipelago's only large native herbivore. We report the first evidence from palaeoecological records of coprophilous fungal spores of the formerly more extensive geographical range of giant tortoises in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. Upland tortoise populations on Santa Cruz declined 500-700 years ago, likely the result of human impact or possible climatic change. Former freshwater wetlands, a now limited habitat-type, were found to have converted to Sphagnum bogs concomitant with tortoise loss, subsequently leading to the decline of several now-rare or extinct plant species.},

abstract = {Species accumulation curves (SACs) chart the increase in recovery of new species as a function of some measure of sampling effort. Studies of parasite diversity can benefit from the application of SACs, both as empirical tools to guide sampling efforts and predict richness, and because their properties are informative about community patterns and the structure of parasite diversity. SACs can be used to infer interactivity in parasite infracommunities, to partition species richness into contributions from different spatial scales and different levels of the host hierarchy (individuals, populations and communities) or to identify modes of community assembly (niche versus dispersal). A historical tendency to treat individual hosts as statistically equivalent replicates (quadrats) seemingly satisfies the sample-based subgroup of SACs but care is required in this because of the inequality of hosts as sampling units. Knowledge of the true distribution of parasite richness over multiple host-derived and spatial scales is far from complete but SACs can improve the understanding of diversity patterns in parasite assemblages. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The late pre-Nebraskan (late Blancan) White Rock fauna was recovered from the ancestral Republican River paleovalley deposit (Belleville Formation) of north-central Kansas. Based on faunal content and delineation of this paleovalley, the Belleville Formation is in part a correlative of the Red Cloud sands and gravels of Nebraska to the northwest and the Holdrege, Fullerton, and Grand Island (in the sense of Lugn, 1935) formations of Nebraska to the northeast. The diverse White Rock fauna consists of at least three mollusks, four ostracodes, one beetle, ten fish, six amphibians, 11 reptiles (Sceloporus holmani, new species), three birds, and 43 mammals [Cynomys (Cynomys) hibbardi, new species]. Based on morphological grade of evolution, the mammals of the White Rock fauna are postsand Draw local fauna (earliest Pleistocene) and pre-Borchers local fauna (Aftonian). Comparison of probable environmental habitats and food habits between the White Rock fossil mammalian fauna and the modern mammalian fauna of the area shows that the White Rock fauna was more diverse than the modern fauna. The mammalian components of the White Rock paleoecosystem appear to be a good representation of the actual mammalian fauna of that time. Collectively, the fauna suggests a climate with less extreme temperature and moisture fluctuations than now oc cu{\~{}}in north-central Kansas. Initial pre-Nebraskan glacial cooling could have allowed climatically incompatible elements of the White Rock fauna to live contemporaneously. Climatic deterioration was not sufficient to force southward taxa characteristic of more southern, warmer, and milder seasons.},

Thanks to still unpublished material, T. lunellensis is diagnosed for the first time and its shell morphology described in detail. This species is uniquely characterized, among others, by tall peripheral bones and by a peculiar shape of the anterior lobe of the plastron, somewhat recalling the species referred to Testudo s.s. (the clade containing the extant species Testudo graeca, Testudo kleinmanni and Testudo marginata). Given that the purported valid species from Lunel-Viel (Middle Pleistocene, France) is still unnamed and undescribed, T. lunellensis from Cova de Gr{\`{a}}cia is currently the stratigraphically youngest extinct Testudo species. The co-occurrence in T. lunellensis of characters typical of both T. hermanni and Testudo s.s. further testifies the phenotypic plasticity of tortoises and the mosaic distribution of morphological characters, which hinders a clear-cut assessment of the relationships of extant tortoises when based exclusively on morphology. Further analyses of the phylogeny of Testudo should consider fossil and extant taxa together, as well as both morphological and genetic characters. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.},

abstract = {Numerous fossil remains (vertebrates, molluscs and plants) were found in more than twenty sites of the S??tto Travertine Complex during the last 150 years. The majority of these remains were recovered from fissures of the travertine, but also from the travertine and an overlying loess-paleosol sequence. The aims of this study were to review the fossil content, to determine the stratigraphical positions of the various vertebrate faunas of S??tto and provide paleoecological interpretation of the periods on the basis of their faunas and floras. In addition, this paper describes new faunas and floras from the sites S??tto 16-20 and provides 14C dates for S??tto 16.On the basis of the new uranium series isotope and optical dating (OSL), the age of the travertine complex is Middle Pleistocene (235??21-314??45ka, MIS 7-9), while the age of the loess-paleosol sequence in superposition of the travertine is Middle-Late Pleistocene (MIS 2-MIS 6). In contrast, the fossils of the travertine indicated an older, Pliocene-Early Pleistocene age. A fissure (S??tto 17) and a red clay layer (S??tto 19) contained mammal faunas of Early-Middle Pleistocene age. These results indicated the existence of older travertine in certain quarries (Hegyh??ti quarry, Cukor quarry).Sedimentological and OSL data of well-dated layers of the loess-paleosol sequence (S??tto/LPS) at S??tto allowed a correlation with the layers of S??tto 6. The paleosol layer in the upper part of the sequence of S??tto 6, was correlated with a pedocomplex of the overlying loess-paleosol sequence, which was dated to MIS 5c (upper, dark soil) and MIS 5e (lower, reddish brown soil). The paleoecological analysis of the mammal and mollusc faunas supported the former interpretation of Novothny etal. (2011) inferring warm, dry climate during the sedimentation of the upper layers, and more humid climate for the lower layers). However, the fauna of the lower soil layer indicated cold climate, so an age of MIS 5d is suggested.Dating of the fissure faunas is based on similarity studies. For some faunas, this method cannot be used, because of the low number of species. On the basis of the species compositions and former interpretations, these faunas originated mainly from sediments that were deposited under cold climatic conditions. Other fissure faunas were dated by AMS 14C (S??tto 16), or by correlation with soil layers of S??tto 6. According to these results, most of the fissure faunas can be correlated with different phases of MIS 5. However, there are a younger (MIS 2) and an older (Early-Middle Pleistocene) fissure fauna also. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {In the semi-arid Karoo of South Africa's central plateau, tortoises are commonly preyed upon by raptors, some of which roost on ledges in the backs of small rock shelters. In the past, any suitable ledge could be occupied only when the shelter was not in use by Bushman hunter–gatherers. Thus, both agents could have contributed tortoise elements to the faunal deposits which accumulated in the shelter fills over the past two millennia. Element survival and breakage rates of tortoise remains in a recent shelter roost accumulation show reversed frequencies to those for tortoise carcasses left at raptor kill sites: what is abundant at the roost (skeletal elements, particularly from the neck and head) are scarce at the kills. When the roost sample is compared with the Bushman foodwaste sample beneath it, the two are readily distinguished by their element composition and condition. A surface sample from a neighbouring shelter without roosting ledges is also rich in skeletals, but lacks the characteristic cranials and vertebrae. Small carnivores are the suspected non-human agents. Although radiocarbon dates indicate an earlier hiatus in this sequence, no such raptor-like tortoise assemblages are detectable at this level.},

abstract = {Kebara's Neanderthal inhabitants used spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) for food and perhaps also for containers. Tortoise mean body size appears to track major paleoclimatic fluctuations documented in the oxygen- isotope record of Soreq Cave (Israel), with larger means during warmer-moister periods and smaller means during colder-drier periods. Body size also tracks site function, with larger means during periods of ephemeral site use. And body size tracks site seasonality, with larger means during warm-season occupations, when tortoises would have been least active. Body size declined sharply toward the end of the Middle Paleolithic, perhaps reflecting a pulse in human population growth that increased the level of predation pressure on these creatures. This conclusion must be regarded with caution, however, because Kebara's early Upper Paleolithic (Ahmarian) occupations were very ephemeral, and therefore should not have impacted local tortoise populations as heavily as the body-size reduction would imply.},

abstract = {A survey is given of the hitherto known turtle taxa from the Plio-Pleistocene of the Chiwondo Beds in Malawi. The paper includes new materials from these beds of Uraha, Karonga District of northern Malawi, collected by the "Hominid Corridor Research Project (HCRP)". The following species are discovered: Pelomedusa subrufa ssp., Pelusios sinuatus (A. Smith 1838), Cyclanorbis senegalensis (Dumeril {\&} Bibron, 1835) and Cycloderma frenatum Peters, 1854, all from the deposits which yielded Homo rudolfensis Alexeev, 1986. In the collection of fossils from this site also include two fragments of clavicular plates of great catfishes (Siluroidea: Clariidae) which remarkably resemble each other in the fragmented form, although they belong to evidently different individuals. The flat-shaped bones originate from the thickened joint area of the pectoral fin sting and the adjoining flat pectoral area. This combines with damages of an otherwise complete turtle shell by early humans. This evidence of consumption of aquatic animals could support an "aquatic ape hypothesis" in the sense of Morgan (1997), Verhaegen (2000) and Niemitz (2006,2010).},

We focus on two topics: (1) the presence or absence of the genus Testudo from the Early Pleistocene to the Holocene in SW Europe; and (2) the relationship between Testudo and the palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions diachronically. In order to address this objective, we collected published and unpublished data from different sites on the eastern Iberian Peninsula. The results obtained by this study demonstrate that Testudo hermanni was the only tortoise present in this area until recent times and its presence in archaeological sites is almost always related to anthropic activities. Finally, the disappearance of Testudo from archaeological sites in some areas is related to climatic changes and events that occurred during the last stages of the Pleistocene. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Patterns of phenotypic change documented in the fossil record offer the only direct view scientists have of evolutionary transitions arrayed over signifi cant durations of time. What lessons should be drawn from these data, however, has proven to be rather contentious. Although we as paleontologists have made great progress in documenting the geological record of phenotypic evolution with greater thoroughness and sophistication, these successes have been limited by the use of verbal models of how phenotypes change. Descriptive terms such as “gradual” have been understood differently by different authors, and this has led to completely incompatible summary statements about the fossil record of morphological evolution. Here I argue that the solution to this ambiguity lies in insisting that different evolutionary interpretations be represented as explicit, statistical models of evolution. With such an approach, the powerful machinery of likelihood-based inference can be help resolve long-standing paleontological questions. Here I fi rst review this approach and some aspects of its implementation. Then, I show how this approach leads to new traction on important issues in evolutionary paleobiology, including: understanding modes of evolution and determining their relative importance, separating evolutionary mode from tempo, assessing the evidence for hypotheses of punctuated change, and detecting adaptive evolution in the fossil record.},

abstract = {TWO amphibian taxa are reported for the first time from the lower to middle Miocene shallow-marine Calvert Formation. These are Batrachosauroides aff. B. dissimulans (a large proteoid salamander) and cf. Notophthalmus robustus (a small newt). Four kinds of identifiable nonmarine turtles were reported previously from this formation. These are Bairdemys miocenica (a pleurodire), Kinosternon sp. (a musk turtle), Hesperotestudo ducateli and Hesperotestudo wilsoni (tortoises). Four additional taxa reported here are Chrysemys isoni n. sp. (a painted turtle), Trachemys sp. (a pond turtle), Floridemys hurdi n. sp. (a small tortoise), and Apalone lima (a softshell turtle). Most of these taxa are known from elsewhere in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from New Jersey to Texas. The regional widespread occurrence of many of these taxa indicates that they represent a modestly diverse community of amphibians, fresh water turtles, and land turtles that were endemic to the Atlantic and Gulf coastal regions of the United States during the late early and early middle Miocene. Their pattern of distribution is similar to that of eastern American land mammals during this time interval, indicating that the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains of the southeastern United States then lay within a single climatic zone that constituted a distinctive and long-lived faunal province throughout the early and middle Miocene (Hemingfordian through Barstovian land mammal ages).},

However, because some parts of the fossil record of turtles are very well known, divergence age estimates from molecular phylogenies often do not differ greatly from those observed directly from the fossil record alone. Also, the phylogenetic position and age of turtle fossil calibrations used in previous studies have not been adequately justified. We provide the first explicitly justified minimum and soft maximum age constraints on 22 clades of turtles following best practice protocols. Using these data we undertook a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis establishing a timescale for the evolution of crown Testudines that we exploit in attempting to address evolutionary questions that cannot be resolved with fossils alone. Some of these questions, such as whether the turtle crown originated in the Triassic or Jurassic, cannot be resolved by our analysis. However, our results generate novel age-of-origination estimates for clades within crown Testudines. Finally, we compare our fossil calibrations and posterior age estimates to those from other studies, revealing substantial differences in results and interpretation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Although skulls of extinct Testudinidae are generally much scarcer than shell remains, when available they provide important data for resolving taxonomic and phylogenetic problems, as illustrated here by two well-preserved giant tortoise skulls from the early Vallesian (MN9, Late Miocene) of Ecoparc de Can Mata (ECM; els Hostalets de Pierola, Valles-Penedes Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula). These specimens, referable to the extinct genus Cheirogaster, differ significantly from C. bolivari and are assigned to C. richardi, whose cranial morphology was previously unknown. This nominal taxon had been considered a junior subjective synonym of C. bolivari, due to a previous neotype designation for the former, based on shell remains, that did not meet the requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. This designation is here considered invalid because it was based on material from a different geographical area, even though remains from the original type locality area were available. Given that the holotype of C. richardi (from the early Vallesian of els Hostalets de Pierola) has been destroyed, to clarify the taxonomic status of this taxon we here designate one of the two ECM skulls as the neotype of the species. On this basis, an emended diagnosis is provided, which leads us to conclude that two different species are recorded from the Iberian Miocene: C. bolivari, from the middle Aragonian of the inner Iberian basins; and C. richardi, from the latest Aragonian and Vallesian of the Valles-Penedes Basin. Additional cranial material of Cheirogaster from inner Iberia would be required to clarify whether these species display distinct geographical distributions and/or different chronostratigraphical ranges. A cladistic analysis of Testudinidae based on cranial morphology supports a sister-taxon relationship between Cheirogaster and Centrochelys. Overall, our results highlight the significance of cranial morphology for attaining a better understanding of turtle taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships.},

Iberian Early Pleistocene sites continue to document the presence of "exotic" herpetofaunal elements that are supposed to have disappeared from the mainland, such as Oriental vipers, agamid lizards, the anguids Pseudopus and Dopasia, and a representative of the green toad group (Bufo viridis sensu lato), as well as possibly gekkonids, a scincid lizard (Lygosominae), the anguid Ragesaurus and blind snake (Scolecophidia). The geographical and temporal pattern of these progressive southward withdrawals and extirpations on the Iberian Peninsula shows that extirpation events occurred in northern Spain at roughly the Olduvai paleomagnetic event and in southern Spain just before the Jaramillo paleomagnetic reversal, thus permitting us to establish a framework that can be used to complement the biochronological zonation of the Iberian Early Pleistocene.},

In Menorca, the Pliocene terrestrial fauna was updated by the discovery and description of the large-sized leporid Nuralagus, several reptiles and an amphibian. In Mallorca, paleontological exploration yielded 2 deposits with a Late Miocene/Early Pliocene chronology, Cal{\'{o}} den Rafelino (CdR) and Na Burguesa-1 (NB-1). So far, 4 new mammalian taxa and 2 new reptiles have been identified for the CdR deposit, whereas the faunal assemblage from the recently discovered deposit (Apr 2012) of NB-1 is currently composed of, at least, 6 terrestrial mammals, 8 reptiles and an amphibian. Its faunal composition and some primitive characteristics of the obtained taxa suggest that the chronology of this deposit is slightly earlier than the CdR. The terrestrial vertebrates recorded in these 2 Mallorcan deposits are changing the view of the paleofaunal assemblage previously known for the Plio-Pleistocene of the island. Morphological characteristics displayed by some of the taxa suggest that these faunas would be at the beginning of an isolated evolution. In this paper we present a preliminary report on the fossils recovered from the NB-1 deposit, as well as some unpublished data from CdR, and we analyze the whole fauna from both Mallorcan deposits, focusing on taxonomical and paleobiogeographical aspects.},

abstract = {Extant chelonians (turtles and tortoises) span almost four orders of magnitude of body size, including the startling examples of gigantism seen in the tortoises of the Galapagos and Seychelles islands. However, the evolutionary determinants of size diversity in chelonians are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of body size evolution in turtles and tortoises within a phylogenetic framework. Our results reveal a pronounced relationship between habitat and optimal body size in chelonians. We found strong evidence for separate, larger optimal body sizes for sea turtles and island tortoises, the latter showing support for the rule of island gigantism in non-mammalian amniotes. Optimal sizes for freshwater and mainland terrestrial turtles are similar and smaller, although the range of body size variation in these forms is qualitatively greater. The greater number of potential niches in freshwater and terrestrial environments may mean that body size relationships are more complicated in these habitats.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 The Linnean Society of London.Fossil testudinids are known in Europe since the Eocene, with several taxa of medium size (from more than 0.3m to less than 0.7m) recognized in the Palaeogene record, most of them being poorly known. The size of several European Neogene taxa was larger (between 1 and 2m). These large testudinids were relatively abundant and diverse, ranging from the early Miocene to the Pleistocene. However, there is a nomenclatural gap at the generic level for the Neogene forms, as their generally used assignment to the more primitive Eocene Cheirogaster cannot be sustained. This is because relatively little material has been assigned to the described species, and also because of the absence of a detailed study comparing all of the European taxa. Here, the European Cenozoic taxa are incorporated for the first time in a data matrix, so that a hypothesis on their phylogenetic relationships is justified. This study identified the large testudinids from the Neogene of Europe as belonging to a monophyletic clade, assigned to the new genus Titanochelon. The hitherto poorly understood 'Testudo' bolivari, proposed nearly a century ago but lacking diagnosis, is analysed in detail. It is recognized as the best-represented large testudinid from the European record, and is identified as the type species of Titanochelon gen. nov. Its comparison with the other Neogene species allowed a detailed study of the new genus and an analysis of its phylogenetic relationships with the other European taxa.},

Between the organic fibrils of the Membrana testacea the development of a calcareous layer can be observed in these eggs.

In recent years, population genetic analyses, which complement organismal approaches in advancing our understanding of local adaptation have become widespread. Here we focus on using population genetics to address some key questions in local adaptation: What traits are involved? What environmental variables are most important? Does local adaptation target the same genes in related species? Do loci responsible for local adaptation exhibit tradeoffs across environments? After discussing these questions we highlight important limitations to population genetic analyses including challenges with obtaining high quality data, deciding which loci are targets of selection, and limits to identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation.},

Here we report our geological mapping and stratigraphic measurement of the DRP area, and the context of a remarkably well-preserved skeleton of the earliest known juvenile hominin at the Dikika DIK-1 locality. Our mapping of the DRP area permits a complete definition of the hominin-bearing Hadar Formation and provides a cohesive structural and tectonic framework defining its relationships to adjacent strata. Our findings reveal the basin-scale tectonic, depositional and palaeoenvironmental history of the area, as well as a clear taphonomic and palaeontological context for the juvenile hominin. Such data are crucial for understanding the environmental context of human evolution, and can be integrated into larger-scale tectonic and palaeoenvironmental studies. Our basin-scale approach to palaeoenvironments provides a means to elucidate the complex geological history occurring at the scale of temporally and geographically controlled fossil point localities, which occur within the rich tectonic and depositional history of the Awash Valley.},

abstract = {A detailed integrated stratigraphic study was carried out on middle Miocene fluvial successions of the Upper Freshwater Molasse (OSM) from the North Alpine Foreland Basin, in eastern Bavaria, Germany. The biostratigraphic investigations yielded six new localities thereby refining the OSM biostratigraphy for units C to E (sensu; Heissig, Actes du Congres BiochroM'97. Mem Trav EPHE, Inst Montpellier 21, 1997) and further improving biostratigraphic correlations between the different sections throughout eastern Bavaria. Radioisotopic ages of 14.55 ± 0.19 and 14.88 ± 0.11 Ma have been obtained for glass shards from the main bentonite horizon and the Ries impactite: two important stratigraphic marker beds used for confirming our magnetostratigraphic calibration to the Astronomical Tuned Neogene Time Scale (ATNTS04; Lourens et al. in Geologic Time Scale 2004, Cambridge University Press, 2004). Paleomagnetic analysis was performed using alternating field (AF) and thermal (TH) demagnetization methods. The AF method revealed both normal and reverse polarities but proofs to yield unreliable ChRM directions for the Puttenhausen section. Using the biostratigraphic information and radioisotopic ages, the magnetostratigraphic records of the different sections are tentatively correlated to the Astronomical Tuned Neogene Time Scale (ATNTS04; Lourens et al. in Geologic Time Scale 2004, Cambridge University Press, 2004). This correlation implies that the main bentonite horizon coincides to chron C5ADn, which is corroborated by its radioisotopic age of 14.55 Ma, whereas the new fossil locality Furth 460, belonging to OSM unit E, probably correlates to chron C5Bn.1r. The latter correlation agrees well with the Swiss Molasse locality Frohberg. Correlations of the older sections are not straightforward. The Brock horizon, which comprises limestone ejecta from the Ries impact, possibly correlates to C5ADr (14.581– 14.784 Ma), implying that, although within error, the radioisotopic age of 14.88 ± 0.11 Ma is somewhat too old. The fossil localities in Puttenhausen, belonging to the older part of OSM unit C, probably coincide with chron C5Cn.2n or older, which is older than the correlations established for the Swiss Molasse.},

abstract = {The extent to which mass extinctions influence body size evolution in major tetrapod clades is inadequately understood. For example, the 'Lilliput effect,' a common feature of mass extinctions, describes a temporary decrease in body sizes of survivor taxa in post-extinction faunas. However, its signature on existing patterns of body size evolution in tetrapods and the persistence of its impacts during post-extinction recoveries are virtually unknown, and rarely compared in both geologic and phylogenetic contexts. Here, I evaluate temporal and phylogenetic distributions of body size in Permo-Triassic therocephalian and cynodont therapsids (eutheriodonts) using a museum collections-based approach and time series model fitting on a regional stratigraphic sequence from the Karoo Basin, South Africa. I further employed rank order correlation tests on global age and clade rank data from an expanded phylogenetic dataset, and performed evolutionary model testing using Brownian (passive diffusion) models. Results support significant size reductions in the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (ca. 252.3 Ma) consistent with some definitions of Lilliput effects. However, this temporal succession reflects a pattern that was underscored largely by Brownian processes and constructive selectivity. Results also support two recent contentions about body size evolution and mass extinctions: 1) active, directional evolution in size traits is rare over macroevolutionary time scales and 2) geologically brief size reductions may be accomplished by the ecological removal of large-bodied species without rapid originations of new small-bodied clades or shifts from long-term evolutionary patterns.},

Herein, we revise the Caimaninae fauna by including novel fossil material as well as the previously described specimens assignable to this clade. In many instances the taxonomic status of species could be confirmed, which is the case in Caiman brevirostris, Globidentosuchus brevirostris, and Purussaurus mirandai, and novel osteological data is presented to corroborate previous anatomical descriptions. In other cases, specimens needed to be reassigned to different taxa; with material previously identified as Caiman lutescens now considered as belonging to either Caiman latirostris or Caiman wannlangstoni, and material of Melanosuchus fisheri reassigned to Caimaninae aff. Melanosuchus fisheri. Furthermore, Mourasuchus nativus is considered to be a junior synonym of Mourasuchus arendsi herein. This suggests that there are only three species of the duck-billed caimanine Mourasuchus present in the Miocene of South America, having colonised the continent from the northwest (Colombia and Peru) during the middle Miocene and moving to the east and southeast (Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina) in the late Miocene. Other specimens, which were previously identified as belonging to the genus Caiman, lack diagnostic features of the modern genus and are instead considered as Caimaninae indet.

Our sampling includes 32 turtle taxa representing all 14 recognized turtle families and an additional six outgroups. Maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and species tree methods produce a single resolved phylogeny. This robust phylogeny shows that proposed phylogenetic names correspond to well-supported clades, and this topology is more consistent with the temporal appearance of clades and paleobiogeography. Future studies of turtle phylogeny using fossil turtles should use this topology as a scaffold for their morphological phylogenetic analyses.},

Some of the identified taxa are reported for the first time in Italy. Others are of particular interest as they help to fill present or past gaps in E-W disjunct ranges. The ecological requirements of the amphibians and reptiles suggest the presence of a typical Mediterranean landscape: a relatively dry environment with water bodies of temporary nature (at least those closer to the sites) surrounded by scattered trees or/and bushes},

abstract = {We present the sampling distributions for the coefficient of skewness, kurtosis, and a joint test of normal- ity for time series observations. We show that when the data are serially correlated, consistent estimates of three-dimensional long-run covariance matrices are needed for testing symmetry or kurtosis. These tests can be used to make inference about any conjectured coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. In the special case of normality, a joint test for the skewness coefficient of 0 and a kurtosis coefficient of 3 can be obtained on construction of a four-dimensional long-run covariance matrix. The tests are developed for demeaned data, but the statistics have the same limiting distributions when applied to regression residuals. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test statistics for symmetry and normality have good finite-sample size and power. However, size distortions render testing for kurtosis almost meaningless except for distri- butions with thin tails, such as the normal distribution. Combining skewness and kurtosis is still a useful test of normality provided that the limiting variance accounts for the serial correlation in the data. The tests are applied to 21 macroeconomic time series},

abstract = {Advances in molecular biology have expanded our understanding of patterns of evolution and our ability to infer phylogenetic relationships. Despite many applications of molecular methods in attempts at resolving the evolutionary relationships among the major clades of turtles, some nodes in the tree have proved to be extremely problematic and have remained unresolved. In this study, we use 14 nuclear loci to provide an in depth look at several of these troublesome nodes and infer the systematic relationships among 11 of the 14 turtle families. We find strong support for two of the most problematic nodes in the deep phylogeny of turtles that have traditionally defied resolution. In particular, we recover strong support for a sister relationship between the Emydidae and the monotypic bigheaded-turtle, Platysternon megacephalum. We also find strong support for a clade consisting of sea turtles, mud and musk turtles, and snapping turtles. Within this clade, snapping turtles (Chelydridae) and mud/musk turtles (Kinosternidae) are sister taxa, again with strong support. Our results emphasize the utility of multi-locus datasets in phylogenetic analyses of difficult problems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It allowed us to determine consensus sequences derived from the transcriptional start/stop signals and the order of protein conservation (nucleoprotein {\textgreater} matrix protein {\textgreater} phosphoprotein) in lyssaviruses. The sequences of the N gene of a fox rabies virus isolate from France (serotype 1), Lagos bat virus (serotype 2), Duvenhage virus (serotype 4), two European bat lyssaviruses (EBL) subtype 1, and two EBL subtype 2 were also determined to study the genetic diversity throughout the whole Lyssavirus genus and reinvestigate the classification of this genus. Six clearly distinct genotypes can be distinguished according to their percentage of amino acid similarity. Genotypes 2 (Lagos bat virus) and 3 (Mokola virus) are the most phylogenetically distant from the vaccinal and classical rabies viruses of genotype 1. Genotypes 4 (Duvenhage virus) and 5 (EBL1) are closely related to each other. Genotype 6 is represented by EBL2. Compared to the N proteins of the four principal serotypes of the Vesiculovirus genus (vesicular stomatitis virus serotype New Jersey and serotype Indiana, Chandipura virus, and Piry virus), the N gene of lyssaviruses exhibits a lower genetic variability.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Phylogeny-based approaches can be used to infer diversification dynamics and the rate and pattern of trait change. Applying these analyses to fossil data often requires time-scaling a cladogram of morphotaxon relationships. Although several time-scaling methods have been developed for this purpose, the incomplete sampling of the fossil record can distort the apparent timing of branching. It is unclear how well different time-scaling methods reconstruct the true temporal relationships or how any such inaccuracy could affect tree-based evolutionary analyses. I developed process-based simulations of the fossil record that allow the comparison of approximated time-scaled trees to true time-scaled trees. I used this simulation framework to test the effect of time-scaling methods on the fidelity of several commonly applied tree-based analyses, across a range of simulation conditions. When the fidelity of time-scaling methods differed, the stochastic “ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}cal3”{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} time-scaling method with ancestral assignment produced preferable results. Estimating rates and models of continuous trait evolution was particularly sensitive to bias from scenarios that forced the insertion of many short branch lengths, a bias that is not solved by any of the considered time-scaling methods in all scenarios. The {\textless}italic{\textgreater}cal3{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} method of time-scaling can be recommended as the preferred time-scaling method among those tested, but caution must be exercised because tree-based analyses are prone to easily overlooked biases. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {* Estimating Shannon entropy and its exponential from incomplete samples is a central objective of many research fields. However, empirical estimates of Shannon entropy and its exponential depend strongly on sample size and typically exhibit substantial bias. This work uses a novel method to obtain an accurate, low-bias analytic estimator of entropy, based on species frequency counts. Our estimator does not require prior knowledge of the number of species. * We show that there is a close relationship between Shannon entropy and the species accumulation curve, which depicts the cumulative number of observed species as a function of sample size. We reformulate entropy in terms of the expected discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, i.e., the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. Our estimator is obtained by applying slope estimators derived from an improved Good-Turing frequency formula. Our method is also applied to estimate mutual information. * Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that if sample size is not unreasonably small the resulting entropy estimator is nearly unbiased. Our estimator generally outperforms all previous methods in terms of bias and accuracy (low mean squared error) especially when species richness is large and there is a large fraction of undetected species in samples. * We discuss the extension of our approach to estimate Shannon entropy for multiple incidence data. The use of our estimator in constructing an integrated rarefaction and extrapolation curve of entropy (or mutual information) as a function of sample size or sample coverage (an aspect of sample completeness) is also discussed.

abstract = {The giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys or Dipsochelys) of the Indian Ocean Islands have been in decline since the first human settlement of the islands. They retain only a single natural population on Aldabra Atoll (and possibly Ile aux Cerfs, where tortoises are descendants of a mixture of indigenous and imported animals). Several additional wild populations are known, resulting from reintroductions to the historic range and introductions outside of that range. The historical distribution of tortoises in Seychelles is summarized, with reliable tortoise records from only 4 coralline islands and 23 granitic islands and the status of all the wild populations reviewed. This includes the first census of the Fre ´gate Island population. In the granitic islands, only 9 islands support tortoises today and the wild population of these islands is estimated at 500–550 adults. In the coralline islands, tortoises are now present on 11 islands, with a total population of over 100,000 (almost all on Aldabra). Climate change impacts over the next 100 yrs are expected to be severe in low-lying areas of the Seychelles Islands attributable to sea-level rise and storm impacts on coastal erosion. These are projected to result in the loss of many populations and significant declines in the Aldabra population. As a result, the species should be regarded as Vulnerable by IUCN Red List Threat Criteria. Reintroduction to more of the high granitic islands could offset some of these projected declines, and it is recommended that such reintroductions be included in future conservation programs to restore ecosystem function.

The log(species)-log(area) curve had the largest adjusted coefficients of determination (r2 values) in 12 of the 17 types, followed by the species-log(area) curve with five of the highest values. When the slopes of the curves were corrected for species overlap among plots with Jaccard's coefficients, the species-log(area) curves estimated values closest to those observed. We combined information from species-area curves and measures of heterogeneity with information on the area covered by each vegetation type and found that the types making the greatest contributions to regional biodiversity covered the smallest areas.

Here we aim to determine whether the spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca, arrived in south-eastern Spain during historical or prehistoric times, and whether its dispersal to the Iberian Peninsula was human-mediated. Location The western Mediterranean Basin (south-eastern Spain, northern Algeria and north-western Morocco). Methods Using 428 samples from 19 sites in North Africa and 18 in south-eastern Spain, we obtained mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b gene and genotypes derived from seven microsatellite loci. These data were employed to obtain population genetics descriptors, haplotype networks, Bayesian cluster analyses and isolation-by-distance patterns. Moreover, we used a Bayesian demographic approach to delimit the dates involved in the range expansion. Results We found lower levels of genetic variability and weak mitochondrial differentiation in the south-eastern Spanish tortoises compared with the North African ones. However, exclusive haplotypes occurred in the Iberian samples and microsatellite cluster analyses revealed moderate levels of admixture across both sides of the Mediterranean. A coastal area in the west of Algeria and the central-southern region in south-eastern Spain are suggested as the most probable founder and arrival places, respectively. Finally, we identified signatures of an ancient bottleneck event approximately 20,00030,000 years ago. Main conclusions The spur-thighed tortoise probably arrived in south-eastern Spain during Late Pleistocene sea-level low stands. The role that humans may have played as dispersers across the Mediterranean remains unclear. Our results are in accordance with other recent findings of trans-Mediterranean expansions during this period and highlight the importance of employing precise methodological approaches before a species can be considered as historically introduced.},

abstract = {Santuari del Camp. 17780 Garriguella (Catalunya) crt@tortugues.cat Abstract: In the territory of Catalonia (Iberian Peninsula) three species of tortoise currently live, Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) and European terrapin (Emys orbicularis). From the palaeontological and archaeological excavations initiated in the first half of the 20th century and reaching to today fossil and sub-fossil remains of these three species have occasionally appeared. In this paper the diverse information, including notes and publications and oral information, as well as the review of material deposited in museums, collections, universities and those that have currently appeared in excavations have been grouped. A description of unpublished material has been made and that described has been reviewed, while incentivising research in excavations. This has enabled an inventory of all the material grouping it chronologically and in this manner leading to the conclusion that in the case of Testudo hermanni, the species has been present in Catalonia from the Lower Pleistocene until today. In the case of Emys orbicular, its presence goes back to the end of the Late Pleistocene and in Mauremys leprosa, it appears in the Holocene All together the tortoise remains appearing at 34 sites have been studied. Introduction The appearance and subsequent study of the fossils studies of Chelonia, at paleontological as will as archaeological sites, in Catalonia date from the beginning of the 20th century (Almeria and Bofill, 1903). From then and up to the present publications and notes have appeared by various authors that referred to the fauna material found in excavations and which in many cases were very imprecise descriptions. Another inconvenience has been trying to find the material since much of it was disseminated in major museums or in small local museums, in university collections and even in private collections. The objective of this work is to bring together all the dispersed information such as publications, notes, oral history and inventory the material found in museums, university and collections.},

Occurrences of fossil Gopherus polyphemus in Lowndes County, Mississippi, and Charleston, Colleton, and Horry counties, South Carolina, represent extralimital records outside the current geographic range of the species. The extensive fossil record indicates G. polyphemus has been part of the xeric-adapted fauna of the southeastern coastal plain for at least two million years. The majority of the Florida records are from Alachua and Marion counties. This concentration corresponds to the high frequency of late Pleistocene fossil deposits in solution features associated with limestone quarries at Arredondo, Haile, and Reddick. A query of 609 sites in the zooarchaeological database of the Environmental Archaeology laboratory at the Florida Museum of Natural History was made to determine the presence of G. polyphemus in 67 archaeological sites from the southeastern United States dating from the latest Pleistocene to the late 19th century. The zooarchaeology collections are heavily weighted in favor of sites from Florida and Georgia. These data are not all inclusive of sites from the Southeast, but present a representative record of the association of this species with humans for nearly 12,000 years. Specimens of G. polyphemus from archeological sites are known from 20 Florida counties and one in Georgia.},

abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is a widely used measure of developmental stability. Nearly all FA indexes estimate the variance of the frequency distribution of right-minus-left (R-L) for a given bilateral character. Differences in these indexes among samples are usually interpreted as reflecting differences in the level of developmental stability. If developmental stabilty is the ability to correct for small, random developmental pertrubations of exclusively environmental origin, then a distribution of R-L, which may include both genetically and environmentally caused asymmetries, may not be a good measure of developmental stability. R-L distributions that depart significantly from a statistical criteria for ideal FA (mean of zero, normal distribution) are unsuitable as descriptors of developmental stability because a fraction of the asymmetry variation may have a genetic basis. In addition, broad-peaked or bimodal (platykurtic) distirubitons of R-L, which reveal the presence of antisymmetry, also imply genetically based asymmetries and thus seem inappropriate as descriptors of developmental stability. Finally, both skewed distributions and narrow-peaked, long-tailed (leptokurtic) distirubtions may arise in mixed samples composed of two or more groups of individuals where each exhibits a different form of asymmetry and where one or more forms of asymmetry may have a genetic basis. Statistical techniques for detecting departures from normality and for detecting heterogeneity of variances among samples are briefly reviewed.},

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based - allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {The Alligator Snapping Turtle, Macrochelys temminckii, is a large, aquatic turtle limited to river systems that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Previous molecular analyses using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggested that Macrochelys exhibits significant genetic variation across its range that includes three distinct genetic assemblages (western, central, and eastern = Suwannee). However, no taxonomic revision or morphological analyses have been conducted previously. In this study, we test previous hypotheses of distinct geographic assemblages by examining morphology, reanalyzing phylogeographic genetic structure, and estimating divergence dating among lineages in a coalescent framework using Bayesian inference. We reviewed the fossil record and discuss phylogeographic and taxonomic implications of the existence of three distinct evolutionary lineages. We measured cranial (n=145) and post-cranial (n=104) material on field-captured individuals and museum specimens. We analyzed 420 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA sequence data for 158 Macrochelys. We examined fossil Macrochelys from ca. 15-16 million years ago (Ma) to the present to better assess historical distributions and evaluate named fossil taxa. The morphological and molecular data both indicate significant geographical variation and suggest three species-level breaks among genetic lineages that correspond to previously hypothesized genetic assemblages. The holotype of Macrochelys temminckii is from the western lineage. Therefore, we describe two new species as Macrochelys apalachicolae sp. nov. from the central lineage and Macrochelys suwanniensis sp. nov. from the eastern lineage (Suwannee River drainage). Our estimates of divergence times suggest that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of M. temminckii (western) and M. apalachicolae (central) existed 3.2-8.9 Ma during the late Miocene to late Pliocene, whereas M. temminckii-M. apalachicolae and M. suwanniensis last shared a MRCA 5.5-13.4 Ma during the mid-Miocene to early Pliocene. Examination of fossil material revealed that the fossil taxon M. floridana is actually a large Chelydra. Our taxonomic revision of Macrochelys has conservation and management implications in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama.},

abstract = {Modern humans, or Homo sapiens, are now the only living species in their genus. But as recently as 100,000 years ago, there were several other species that belonged to the genus Homo. Together with modern humans, these extinct human species, our immediate ancestors and their close relatives, are collectively referred to as ‘hominins'. Now Berger et al. report the recent discovery of an extinct species from the genus Homo that was unearthed from deep underground in what has been named the Dinaledi Chamber, in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa. The species was named Homo naledi; ‘naledi' means ‘star' in Sotho (also called Sesotho), which is one of the languages spoken in South Africa. The unearthed fossils were from at least 15 individuals and include multiple examples of most of the bones in the skeleton. Based on this wide range of specimens from a single site, Berger et al. describe Homo naledi as being similar in size and weight to a small modern human, with human-like hands and feet. Furthermore, while the skull had several unique features, it had a small braincase that was most similar in size to other early hominin species that lived between four million and two million years ago. Homo naledi's ribcage, shoulders and pelvis also more closely resembled those of earlier hominin species than those of modern humans. The Homo naledi fossils are the largest collection of a single species of hominin that has been discovered in Africa so far and, in a related study, Dirks et al. describe the setting and context for these fossils. However, since the age of the fossils remains unclear, one of the next challenges will be to date the remains to provide more information about the early evolution of humans and their close relatives.},

abstract = {Evidence for the acquisition of nutritionally dense food resources by early Pleistocene hominins has implications for both hominin biology and behavior. Aquatic fauna may have comprised a source of highly nutritious resources to hominins in the Turkana Basin at {\~{}}1.95Ma. Here we employ multiple datasets to examine the issue of aquatic resource use in the early Pleistocene. This study focuses on four components of aquatic faunal assemblages (1) taxonomic diversity, (2) skeletal element proportion, (3) bone fragmentation and (4) bone surface modification. These components are used to identify associations between early Pleistocene aquatic remains and hominin behavior at the site of FwJj20 in the Koobi Fora Fm. (Kenya). We focus on two dominant aquatic species: catfish and turtles. Further we suggest that data on aquatic resource availability as well as ethnographic examples of aquatic resource use complement our observations on the archaeological remains from FwJj20. Aquatic food items provided hominins with a valuable nutritional alternative to an exclusively terrestrial resource base. We argue that specific advantages afforded by an aquatic alternative to terrestrial resources include (1) a probable reduction in required investment of energy relative to economic return in the form of nutritionally dense food items, (2) a decrease in the technological costs of resource acquisition, and (3) a reduced level of inter-specific competition associated with carcass access and an associated reduction of predation risk relative to terrestrial sources of food. The combined evidence from FwJj20 suggests that aquatic resources may have played a substantial role in early Pleistocene diets and these resources may have been overlooked in previous interpretations of hominin behavior.},

abstract = {During the Pleistocene, the world saw a dramatic number of extinctions of very large terrestrial species. The losses of these megafauna have been attributed to either of two different hypotheses. One hypothesis states that global climate changes occurring during the Pleistocene caused environmental pressures that forced the extinction of several megafaunal species. The second hypothesis proposes that the global spread of Homo sapiens and hunter-gatherer subsistence practices were responsible for these deaths. Examining these two theories reveals that neither climate changes nor human overkill were likely to be individually responsible for the Pleistocene extinctions. Instead, a synthetic model that includes both hypotheses appears to be the most plausible explanation for the Pleistocene losses.},

abstract = {Starting in the late 1970s, ecologists began unraveling the role of recently extinct large vertebrates in evolutionary ecology and ecosystem dynamics. Three decades later, practitioners are now considering the role of ecological history in conservation practice, and some have called for restoring missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential using taxon substitutes – extant, functionally similar taxa – to replace extinct species. This pro-active approach to biodiversity conservation has proved controversial. Yet, rewilding with taxon substitutes, or ecological analogues, is now being integrated into conservation and restoration programmes around the world. Empirical evidence is emerging that illustrates how taxon substitutions can restore missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential. However, a major roadblock to a broader evaluation and application of taxon substitution is the lack of practical guidelines within which they should be conducted. While the International Union for Conservation of Nature's reintroduction guidelines are an obvious choice, they are unsuitable in their current form. We recommend necessary amendments to these guidelines to explicitly address taxon substitutions. A second impediment to empirical evaluations of rewilding with taxon substitutions is the sheer scale of some proposed projects; the majority involves large mammals over large areas. We present and discuss evidence that large and giant tortoises (family Testudinidae) are a useful model to rapidly provide empirical assessments of the use of taxon substitutes on a comparatively smaller scale. Worldwide, at least 36 species of large and giant tortoises went extinct since the late Pleistocene, leaving 32 extant species. We examine the latent conservation potential, benefits, and risks of using tortoise taxon substitutes as a strategy for restoring dysfunctional ecosystems. We highlight how, especially on islands, conservation practitioners are starting to employ extant large tortoises in ecosystems to replace extinct tortoises that once played keystone roles.},

Two skewness statistics are examined: the Fisher-Pearson standardized third moment coefficient, and the Pearson 2 coefficient that compares the mean and median. The former is reported in statistical software packages, while the latter is all but forgotten in textbooks. Given its intuitive appeal, why did Pearson 2 disappear? Is it ever useful? Using Monte Carlo simulation, tables of percentiles are created for Pearson 2. It is shown that while Pearson 2 has lower power, it matches classroom explanations of skewness and can be calculated when summarized data are available. This paper suggests reviving the Pearson 2 skewness statistic for the introductory statistics course because it compares the mean to the median in a precise way that students can understand. The paper reiterates warnings about what any skewness statistic can actually tell us.},

abstract = {A STUDY of the early Pleistocene rocks of the nonglaciated region of north-central Nebraska shows that a paleovalley fill (Keim Formation, new name) that contained the Sand Draw local fauna was preglacial. The stratigraphic position of the overlying Long Pine Formation, new name, is significant because it is the first evidence of a fluvioglacial outwash in the area. Two later sets of deposits overlie the Long Pine Formation: Duffy and Pettijohn formations, new names. The source of the gravel in the Long Pine Formation has been a matter of conjecture, some geologists believing it to be the Black Hills, and others the Rocky Mountains. Supporting evidence for either provenience is lacking. Devonian fossils in the Long Pine Gravel indicate that the source was to the northnortheast near Lake Winnepegosis in Manitoba. The Sand Draw local fauna, previously considered Nebraskan (first continental glacier) or Aftonian (first interstadial), correlates with other Blancan faunas, and is the most diverse and northern known of Blancan time. The following groups comprise the fauna: 42 taxa of' molluscs, 14 taxa of ostracodes, 10 taxa of fishes (Chmbtyttus serratus, new species), four taxa of amphibiaris, 14 taxa of reptiles (Geochelone oelrichi, new species), at least 10 taxa of birds, and 35 taxa of mammals. The mammalian fauna has these new forms: a shrew, Planisorex dixonensis, new genus; four rodents, .!emphilus boothi, new species; Spmphilus mltoni, new species; Ophiomys magilli, new species; Ophiomys fn'cki, new species; and a mustelid, Buisnictis bursowsi, new species. Some of these fossils indicate that the early Pleistocene climate was warmer than the present one, subhumid, with evapo-transpiration about equal to average annual precipitation. Presence of the large land tortoise, Geochelone, is evidence that the temperature seldom, if ever, dropped below 0C. Pollen from the Keim Formation is definitely not of glacial type.},

For some authors, the systematic obtaining of these animals is only part of the subsistence strategies used by anatomically modern Humans. However, the consumption of small prey dates back to the Plio-Pleistocene chronologies in some sites. Although the utilization of leporids has been recorded in several pre-Late Pleistocene European sites, the evidence of tortoise consumption is documented not as common for these periods. However, Level IV of Bolomor Cave has clear diagnostic elements to document the acquisition and use of tortoises (Testudo hermanni) for food in the form of: (1) cutmarks on limb bones and ventral surface of the carapace and plastron; (2) presence of burning on tortoise skeleton and shell; (3) elements of anthropogenic breakage on carapace and plastron: percussion pits, percussion notches and impact flakes; and (4) human toothmarks on limb bones. This paper tries to examine the possible patterns in the tortoise consumption sequence from Level IV of Bolomor Cave and improves data on the butchery process and tortoise consumption in the Late Middle Pleistocene. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A major macroevolutionary question concerns how long-term patterns of body-size evolution are underpinned by smaller scale processes along lineages. One outstanding long-term transition is the replacement of basal therapsids (stem-group mammals) by archosauromorphs, including dinosaurs, as the dominant large-bodied terrestrial fauna during the Triassic (approx. 252-201 million years ago). This landmark event preceded more than 150 million years of archosauromorph dominance. We analyse a new body-size dataset of more than 400 therapsid and archosauromorph species spanning the Late Permian-Middle Jurassic. Maximum-likelihood analyses indicate that Cope's rule (an active within-lineage trend of body-size increase) is extremely rare, despite conspicuous patterns of body-size turnover, and contrary to proposals that Cope's rule is central to vertebrate evolution. Instead, passive processes predominate in taxonomically and ecomorphologically more inclusive clades, with stasis common in less inclusive clades. Body-size limits are clade-dependent, suggesting intrinsic, biological factors are more important than the external environment. This clade-dependence is exemplified by maximum size of Middle-early Late Triassic archosauromorph predators exceeding that of contemporary herbivores, breaking a widely-accepted 'rule' that herbivore maximum size greatly exceeds carnivore maximum size. Archosauromorph and dinosaur dominance occurred via opportunistic replacement of therapsids following extinction, but were facilitated by higher archosauromorph growth rates.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Paleobiologists have used many different methods for estimating rates of origination and extinction. Unfortunately, all equations that consider entire age ranges are distorted by the Pull of the Recent, the Signor-Lipps effect, and simple edge effects. Attention has been paid recently to an equation of Foote's that considers counts of taxa either crossing the bottom and top of an interval or crossing one boundary but not the other. This generalized boundary-crosser (BC) method has important advantages but is still potentially subject to the major biases. The only published equation that circumvents all of them is the three-timer (3T) log ratio, which does so by focusing on a four-interval moving window. Although it is highly accurate it is noisy when turnover rates are very high or sampling is very poor. More precise values are yielded by a newly derived equation that uses the same counts. However, it also considers taxa sampled in a window's first and fourth intervals but missing from the third (i.e., gap-fillers). Simulations show that the 3T, gap-filler (GF), and BC equations yield identical values when sampling and turnover are uniform through time. When applied to Phanerozoic-scale marine animal data, 3T and GF agree well but the BC rates are systematically lower. The apparent reason is that (1) long-ranging but infrequently sampled genera are less likely to be split up by taxonomists and (2) the BC equation overweights taxa with long ranges. Thus, BC rates pertain more to rare genera that are likely to represent large clades whereas GF rates pertain more to actual species-level patterns. Given these results, all published turnover rates based either on genus-level data or on age ranges must be reconsidered because they may reflect taxonomic practices more strongly than the species-level dynamics of interest to biologists.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts {\~{}}8.7 million (± 1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which {\~{}}2.2 million (± 0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86{\%} of existing species on Earth and 91{\%} of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

abstract = {Giant tortoises are known from several remote islands in the Indian Ocean (IO). Our present understanding of ocean circulation patterns, the age of the islands, and the life history traits of giant tortoises makes it difficult to com- prehend how these animals arrived on such small, remote and geologically young (8–1.5 Ma) landmasses. For colonization to have occurred by dispersal, giant tortoises must either have originated in Madagascar or Africa and swum for hundreds of km against the ocean currents, or have launched themselves from the eastern IO margin and drifted with the currents over several thou- sands of km of open ocean. After these navigational feats, the tortoises would have needed to found new, viable populations on potentially inhospitable vol- canic or coral outcrops. Geologically recent sea level changes are likely to have eliminated terrestrial life from islands like Aldabra, complicating the scenario. We reviewed information relating to IO geology, the evolution and ecology of giant tortoises, and the spread of humans within the region, and propose an alternative explanation: we posit that giant tortoises were introduced to the IO islands by early Austronesian sailors, possibly to establish provisioning stations for their journeys, just as European sailors did in more recent historical times.},

abstract = {Today, the only surviving wild population of giant tortoises in the Indian Ocean occurs on the island of Aldabra. However, giant tortoises once inhabited islands throughout the western Indian Ocean. Madagascar, Africa, and India have all been suggested as possible sources of colonization for these islands. To address the origin of Indian Ocean tortoises (Dipsochelys, formerly Geochelone gigantea), we sequenced the 12S, 16S, and cyt b genes of the mitochondrial DNA. Our phylogenetic analysis shows Dipsochelys to be embedded within the Malagasy lineage, providing evidence that Indian Ocean giant tortoises are derived from a common Malagasy ancestor. This result points to Madagascar as the source of colonization for western Indian Ocean islands by giant tortoises. Tortoises are known to survive long oceanic voyages by floating with ocean currents, and thus, currents flowing northward towards the Aldabra archipelago from the east coast of Madagascar would have provided means for the colonization of western Indian Ocean islands. Additionally, we found an accelerated rate of sequence evolution in the two Malagasy Pyxis species examined. This finding supports previous theories that shorter generation time and smaller body size are related to an increase in mitochondrial DNA substitution rate in vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {On the basis of paleontological content (vertebrates and palynology) and facies analysis from river banks, road cuts, and three wells, we have assigned the uppermost levels of the Solim{\~{o}}es Formation in western Amazonia, Brazil, to the Late Miocene. The vertebrate fossil record from outcropping sediments is assigned to the Huayquerian-Mesopotamian mammalian biozones, spanning 9-6.5. Ma. Additionally, we present results that demonstrate that deposits in Peruvian Amazonia attributed to Miocene tidal environments are actually fluvial sediments that have been misinterpreted (both environmentally and chronologically) by several authors.The entire Late Miocene sequence was deposited in a continental environment within a subsiding basin. The facies analysis, fossil fauna content, and palynological record indicate that the environment of deposition was dominated by avulsive rivers associated with megafan systems, and avulsive rivers in flood basins (swamps, lakes, internal deltas, and splays). Soils developed on the flatter, drier areas, which were dominated by grasslands and gallery forest in a tropical to subtropical climate.These Late Miocene sediments were deposited from westward of the Purus arch up to the border of Brazil with Peru (Divisor Ranges) and Bolivia (Pando block). Eastward of the Iquitos structural high, however, more detailed studies, including vertebrate paleontology, need to be performed to calibrate with more precision the ages of the uppermost levels of the Solim{\~{o}}es Formation.The evolution of the basin during the late Miocene is mainly related to the tectonic behavior of the Central Andes ({\~{}}3°-15°S). At approximately 5. Ma, a segment of low angle of subduction was well developed in the Nazca Plate, and the deformation in the Subandean foreland produced the inland reactivation of the Divisor/Contamana Ranges and tectonic arrangements in the Eastern Andes. During the Pliocene southwestern Brazilian Amazonia ceased to be an effective sedimentary basin, and became instead an erosional area that contributed sediments to the Amazon fluvial system. At that time, the lowland fluvial systems of southwestern Amazonia (the Purus, Jurua and Javar{\'{i}} basins) become isolated from the Andes by the newly formed north-flowing Ucayali system and south-east flowing Madre de Dios System. It was during the early Pliocene that the Amazon fluvial system integrated regionally and acquired its present appearance, and also when it started to drain water and sediments on a large scale to the Atlantic Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Nuralagus rex, gen. et sp. nov., is characterized by an array of odd traits unknown for lagomorphs. Most out- standing are the gigantic size (average 12 kg), the robust postcranial skeleton with unique morphological traits (short manus and pes with splayed phalanges, short and stiff vertebral column with reduced extension/flexion capabilities), and the rel- atively small size of sense-related areas of the skull (tympanic bullae, orbits, braincase, and choanae). These morphological traits denote an important decrease in locomotor and neurological activities and, hence, a decrease in metabolic energy expen- diture, which is concordant with the ecological conditions of the insular environment characterized by absence of predators and low levels of resource supply. Our discovery enhances the importance of the frequently neglected fossil record for our understanding evolution on islands, because it provides the perspective of time and adds valuable data from fossil insular ecosystems unaffected by anthropogenic alterations.},

abstract = {Abaco Island, located on Little Bahama Bank, is the most northeastern island in the Bahamian archipelago. Abaco exhibits typical carbonate island karst features Such as karren, blue holes, pit caves, banana holes and flank margin caves. Landforms that resemble tropical cone karst and pseudokarst tafoni caves are also present. The three cave types of Abaco-flank margin caves, pit caves, and tafoni caves-are abundant, but each forms by very different mechanisms. Flank margin caves are hypogenic in origin, forming due to mixing dissolution at the margin of the freshwater lens. Since the lens margin is concordant with sea level, flank margin caves record the position of sea level during their formation. Flank margin caves exhibit phreatic dissolutional features Such as bell holes, dissolutional cusps and spongework. Pit caves form as vadose fast-flow routes to the freshwater lens and are common oil the Pleistocene eolianite ridges of the Bahamas. Pit caves are characterized by their near-vertical or stair-step profiles. Because pit caves form in the vadose zone, their position is not tied to sea level. Tafoni caves are pseudokarst features that form when the soft interior of all eolianite ridge is exposed to subaerial erosion. Since tafoni caves form by mechanical processes, they do not exhibit phreatic dissolutional features. Tafoni caves may be mistaken as flank margin caves by the untrained observer, which may cause problems when using caves as sea-level indicators. Each of Abaco's unique cave types may preserve depositional and erosional features that are useful to the researcher in creating general geologic timelines. While these timelines may not give exact dates, they are useful in the Field for understanding depositional boundaries and determining sequences of geologic events.},

The growth rate with size is plotted, the time scale being derived from the number of rings on the shields of the shell; and the growth curve is compared with that for captive tortoises. Variation in many characters of supposed taxonomic value is explained as the influence of environmental factors on the normal growth pattern, and of non-adaptive differences expressed during adult life. The present separation of north and south Aldabra, and Seychelles forms is not supported. An explanation is suggested for the uniformity of shape among tortoises.

Our present understanding of ocean circulation patterns, the age of the islands, and the life history traits of giant tortoises makes it difficult to com- prehend how these animals arrived on such small, remote and geologically young (8–1.5 Ma) landmasses. For colonization to have occurred by dispersal, giant tortoises must either have originated in Madagascar or Africa and swum for hundreds of km against the ocean currents, or have launched themselves from the eastern IO margin and drifted with the currents over several thou- sands of km of open ocean. After these navigational feats, the tortoises would have needed to found new, viable populations on potentially inhospitable vol- canic or coral outcrops. Geologically recent sea level changes are likely to have eliminated terrestrial life from islands like Aldabra, complicating the scenario. We reviewed information relating to IO geology, the evolution and ecology of giant tortoises, and the spread of humans within the region, and propose an alternative explanation: we posit that giant tortoises were introduced to the IO islands by early Austronesian sailors, possibly to establish provisioning stations for their journeys, just as European sailors did in more recent historical times.},

abstract = {The nature of evolutionary changes recorded by the fossil record has long been controversial, with particular disagreement concerning the relative frequency of gradual change versus stasis within lineages. Here, I present a large-scale, statistical survey of evolutionary mode in fossil lineages. Over 250 sequences of evolving traits were fit by using maximum likelihood to three evolutionary models: directional change, random walk, and stasis. Evolution in these traits was rarely directional; in only 5{\%} of fossil sequences was directional evolution the most strongly supported of the three modes of change. The remaining 95{\%} of sequences were divided nearly equally between random walks and stasis. Variables related to body size were significantly less likely than shape traits to experience stasis. This finding is in accord with previous suggestions that size may be more evolutionarily labile than shape and is consistent with some but not all of the mechanisms proposed to explain evolutionary stasis. In general, similar evolutionary patterns are observed across other variables, such as clade membership and temporal resolution, but there is some evidence that directional change in planktonic organisms is more frequent than in benthic organisms. The rarity with which directional evolution was observed in this study corroborates a key claim of punctuated equilibria and suggests that truly directional evolution is infrequent or, perhaps more importantly, of short enough duration so as to rarely register in paleontological sampling.},

abstract = {The influence of within-species variation and covariation on evolutionary patterns is well established for generational and macroevolutionary processes, most prominently through genetic lines of least resistance. However, it is not known whether intraspecific phenotypic variation also directs microevolutionary trajectories into the long term when a species is subject to varying environmental conditions. Here we present a continuous, high-resolution bivariate record of size and shape changes among 12,633 individual planktonic foraminifera of a surviving and an extinct-going species over 500,000 years. Our study interval spans the late Pliocene to earliest Pleistocene intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation, an interval of profound climate upheaval that can be divided into three phases of increasing glacial intensity. Within each of these three Plio-Pleistocene climate phases, the within-population allometries predict evolutionary change from one time step to the next and that the within-phase among-population (i.e., evolutionary) allometries match their corresponding static (within-population) allometries. However, the evolutionary allometry across the three climate phases deviates significantly from the static and phase-specific evolutionary allometries in the extinct-going species. Although intraspecific variation leaves a clear signature on mean evolutionary change from one time step to the next, our study suggests that the link between intraspecific variation and longer-term micro- and macroevolutionary phenomena is prone to environmental perturbation that can overcome constraints induced by within-species trait covariation.},

abstract = {In this chapter we discuss methods for analyzing continuous traits, with an emphasis on those approaches that rely on explicit statistical models of evolution and incorporate genealogical information (ancestor–descendant or phylogenetic relationships). After discussing the roles of models and genealogy in evolutionary inference, we summarize the properties of commonly used models including random walks (Brownian motion), directional evolution, and stasis. These models can be used to devise null-hypothesis tests about evolutionary patterns, but it is often better to fit and compare models equally using information criteria and related approaches. We apply these methods to a published data set of dental measurements in a sequence of ancestor–descendant populations in the early primate Cantius, with the particular goal of determining the best-supported mode of evolutionary change in this lineage. We also assess a series of questions about the evolution of femoral dimensions in several clades of dinosaurs, including testing for a trend of increasing body size (Cope's Rule), testing for correlations among characters, and reconstructing ancestral states. Finally, we list briefly some additional models, approaches, and issues that arise in genealogically informed analyses of phenotypic evolution. PRELIMINARIES:},

abstract = {Paleocene and Eocene floras of Russia and adjacent regions are reviewed with an interpretation of climatic conditions under which they developed. Floristic and climatic changes in western and central regions of Russia in the Paleocene and in the first part of the Eocene were caused by the dynamics and rearrangement of the systems of marine seaways: a longitudinal seaway, which connected the Arctic basin with the marginal seas of Northern Peri-Tethys (Turanian, South Russian and others), and a latitudinal seaway, which connected the marginal seas of Northern Peri-Tethys with the Atlantic Ocean. As these systems were progressively reduced, the climate in the middle latitudes changed from paratropical (like in West and Central Europe) to a subtropical monsoon climate with wet summers (Late Ypresian to Lutetian), and later to a climate with wet winters (Late Lutetian to the first part of the Priabonian). Floristic changes reflect these climatic trends. In the Paleogene, cold currents constantly influenced the climate of regions of the northwestern Pacific and facilitated development of a warm-temperate mesophilic flora. A warmer episode took place in the Early Eocene. At this time thermophilic plants (Sabal, Myrtaceae and Lauraceae) reached Koryakia, North Western Kamchatka, probably as a result of northward migration. Some subtropical plants existed near the Recent Polar circle. The subtropical Raichikha-type Flora lost temperate elements and, by ecological and climatic types, it is more similar to the Recent flora of South-West and South China.},

Platychelys sp., Platysternon megacephalum) and poorly known shell material (e.g., Kirtlington turtles) could be assessed. Aff. Platychelys sp., as well as Kirtlington histomorph I are both assigned to Pleurosternidae herein. Assignment of the latter taxon would indicate that the fossil record of Pleurosternidae has to be extended back into the Middle Jurassic. P. megacephalum was found to share some histological features with Chelydridae, thus supporting prior morphological hypothesis. In the other major turtle groups, the bone histology does not show clear phylogenetic signals or functional factors override existing phylogenetic signals respectively. One functional aspect that profoundly influences turtle shell bone microstructures is the adaptation to an aquatic habitat and life-style. In this respect, all turtles were grouped into four categories (I “terrestrial environment” to IV “extreme adaptation to aquatic/marine environments”), based on their ecology/palaeoecology. Comparison of the oldest known turtles with recent ‘aquatic' and ‘terrestrial' turtles independently revealed a terrestrial palaeoecology for the basal Testudinata. Shell bone microstructures can further elucidate the origin of turtles. Based on the comparison of basal turtles and several outgroup taxa including osteoderm-bearing pareiasaurs, mammals, placodonts, archosauromorphs and lepidosaurs, the origin of turtles is hypothesised to lie within Diapsida, with close relationships to archosaurs. In the case of placodont armour, a unique bone tissue (here termed ´postcranial fibro- cartilaginous bone`) is described and a general model of osteogenesis is proposed.},

Second, we predicted that the shell shapes (independent of size) of smaller turtles will be stronger than those of larger turtles to compensate for the reduction in strength that accompanies a decrease in size.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. ABSTRACT. -Cladistic analyses of 26 selected cranial characters of Geochelone did not support the implications of previous classifications. Most subgenera do not share derived features and, thus, are not considered monophyletic. The subgenus Manouria (G. emys and G. impressa), although not monophyletic, is the most primitive group of Geochelone, because its members lack most derived features. Indotestudo (G. elongata and G. travancorica) may be monophyletic; all members possess a ridge extending from the base of the inferior processes of the parietals anterolaterally over the dorsal surfaces of the pterygoids and palatines to the external pterygoid processes. Possession of a short trachea suggests that the subgenus Indotestudo should not be allocated to the genus Geoche-lone. Aldabrachelys is certainly monophyletic by virtue of a shared derived vertically elongated external narial opening. Other subgenera (Chelonoidis, Geochelone, Asterochelys) have no shared derived characters. Possible relationships between G. (Geochelone) pardalis and G. (Asterochelys) yniphora and G. (Geochelone) elegans, G. (Aldabrachelys) gigantea and G. (Asterochelys) radiata are suggested by cladistic analyses, but must await examination of additional anatomical systems, inclusion and analyses of other tortoise genera, and consideration of functional hypotheses. Until such analyses are completed, the subgenera of living Geochelone should be abandoned.},

abstract = {The small tortoises of southern Africa include the only testudinid taxa that produce single-egg clutches. This group includes the world's smallest tortoise, Homopus signatus (Gmelin, 1789), which inhabits a harsh, and environment. Climate and body size may influence reproductive output, so we hypothesized that the east-west aridity gradient in southern Africa affects egg and clutch size of the small indigenous tortoises, and that the morphology of H. signatus constrains egg size, preventing the formation of optimal eggs. Here we show that aridity and unpredictable rainfall determine which of these tortoise taxa produce single-egg clutches. Taxa in less predictable environments produce larger eggs relative to body size than do taxa in more predictable environments. Homopus signatus produces the largest egg relative to body size, probably to enhance offspring survival in its harsh environment. Body size, pelvic aperture size, and the narrow anal gap of H. signatus appear to constrain egg size. Despite these constraints, females produce rigid-shelled eggs larger than the pelvic canal and use pelvic kinesis to pass eggs at oviposition: both features are unknown in other chelonians and emphasize the selective advantage of large eggs to H. signatus},

abstract = {Testudinidae is a clade of tortoises known in Europe from the early Eocene. It is the only lineage of terrestrial turtles identified in the post-Paleocene record of this continent. However, very little information on the taxonomy and systematics of the Eocene representatives is currently available. The oldest testudinids from Europe, recovered in several countries, are studied here. Some of them were previously attributed to genera defined in North America. The hypothesis suggesting that the European Eocene testudinids correspond to genera exclusive to this continent is confirmed here. In this sense, two new genera, Fontainechelon (early Eocene) and Pelorochelon (middle Eocene), are proposed. The largest collection of European Paleogene testudinids, from the middle Eocene of the Spanish site of Mazater{\'{o}}n (Soria), is analyzed for the first time. A new species from this locality is defined. The validity of various previously proposed taxa is refuted, and the diagnosis of several forms is emended. Thus, the diversity, taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships, and biogeographical and stratigraphic distributions of the European primitive representatives of this successful extant clade are analyzed.},

abstract = {Restoration of extirpated species via captive breeding has typically relied on population viability as the primary criterion for evaluating success. This criterion is inadequate when species reintroduction is undertaken to restore ecological functions and interactions. Herein we report on the demographic and ecological outcomes of a five-decade-long population restoration program for a critically endangered species of "ecosystem engineer": the endemic Espa{\~{n}}ola giant Galapagos tortoise (Chelonoidis hoodensis). Our analysis of complementary datasets on tortoise demography and movement, tortoise-plant interactions and Espa{\~{n}}ola Island's vegetation history indicated that the repatriated tortoise population is secure from a strictly demographic perspective: about half of tortoises released on the island since 1975 were still alive in 2007, in situ reproduction is now significant, and future extinction risk is low with or without continued repatriation. Declining survival rates, somatic growth rates, and body condition of repatriates suggests, however, that resources for continued population growth are increasingly limited. Soil stable carbon isotope analyses indicated a pronounced shift toward woody plants in the recent history of the island's plant community, likely a legacy of changes in competitive relations between woody and herbaceous plants induced by now-eradicated feral goats and prolonged absence of tortoises. Woody plants are of concern because they block tortoise movement and hinder recruitment of cactus-a critical resource for tortoises. Tortoises restrict themselves to remnant cactus patches and areas of low woody plant density in the center of the island despite an apparent capacity to colonize a far greater range, likely because of a lack of cactus elsewhere on the island. We conclude that ecosystem-level criteria for success of species reintroduction efforts take much longer to achieve than population-level criteria; moreover, reinstatement of endangered species as fully functioning ecosystem engineers may often require large-scale habitat restoration efforts in concert with population restoration.},

Here, we studied the body-size trends of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. megalodon{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} through its temporal and geographic range to better understand its ecology and evolution. Given that this species was the last of the megatooth lineage, a group of species that shows a purported size increase through time, we hypothesized that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. megalodon{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} also displayed this trend, increasing in size over time and reaching its largest size prior to extinction. We found that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. megalodon{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} body-size distribution was left-skewed (suggesting a long-term selective pressure favoring larger individuals), and presented significant geographic variation (possibly as a result of the heterogeneous ecological constraints of this cosmopolitan species) over geologic time. Finally, we found that stasis was the general mode of size evolution of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. megalodon{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (i.e., no net changes over time), contrasting with the trends of the megatooth lineage and our hypothesis. Given that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. megalodon{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is a relatively long-lived species with a widely distributed fossil record, we further used this study system to provide a deep-time perspective to the understanding of the body-size trends of marine apex predators. For instance, our results suggest that (1) a selective pressure in predatory sharks for consuming a broader range of prey may favor larger individuals and produce left-skewed distributions on a geologic time scale; (2) body-size variations in cosmopolitan apex marine predators may depend on their interactions with geographically discrete communities; and (3) the inherent characteristics of shark species can produce stable sizes over geologic time, regardless of the size trends of their lineages. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Previous analyses of evolutionary patterns, or modes, in fossil lineages have focused overwhelmingly on three simple models: stasis, random walks, and directional evolution. Here we use likelihood methods to fit an expanded set of evolutionary models to a large compilation of ancestor-descendant series of populations from the fossil record. In addition to the standard three models, we assess more complex models with punctuations and shifts from one evolutionary mode to another. As in previous studies, we find that stasis is common in the fossil record, as is a strict version of stasis that entails no real evolutionary changes. Incidence of directional evolution is relatively low (13{\%}), but higher than in previous studies because our analytical approach can more sensitively detect noisy trends. Complex evolutionary models are often favored, overwhelmingly so for sequences comprising many samples. This finding is consistent with evolutionary dynamics that are, in reality, more complex than any of the models we consider. Furthermore, the timing of shifts in evolutionary dynamics varies among traits measured from the same series. Finally, we use our empirical collection of evolutionary sequences and a long and highly resolved proxy for global climate to inform simulations in which traits adaptively track temperature changes over time. When realistically calibrated, we find that this simple model can reproduce important aspects of our paleontological results. We conclude that observed paleontological patterns, including the prevalence of stasis, need not be inconsistent with adaptive evolution, even in the face of unstable physical environments.},

This site provides the oldest in situ evidence that hominins, predating Homo erectus, enjoyed access to carcasses of terrestrial and aquatic animals that they butchered in a well-watered habitat. It also provides the earliest definitive evidence of the incorporation into the hominin diet of various aquatic animals including turtles, crocodiles, and fish, which are rich sources of specific nutrients needed in human brain growth. The evidence here shows that these critical brain-growth compounds were part of the diets of hominins before the appearance of Homo ergaster/erectus and could have played an important role in the evolution of larger brains in the early history of our lineage.},

How much did the European herpetofauna evolve during the Cenozoic? Did it experience any turnover phenomenon? Is it possible to find any synchrony in mammalian and herpetofaunal turnover? Focusing on some major mammal turnovers (i.e. those limiting different epochs) it appears evident that also the herpetofauna experienced some more or less abrupt changes that are sometimes perceivable at suprabasinial scale but are often detected in relatively restricted areas.},

abstract = {Microvertebrates are generally well suited for drawing inferences on past environmental conditions because they are closely bound to the areas in which they lived. In this paper, we discuss palaeoecological implications of two microvertebrate concentrations in the Middle Pleistocene site Qesem Cave in Israel. The ecological preferences of the nearest living relatives of the microvertebrate taxa recorded in Concentration 1 (squares L-N/13-15) and 2 (squares G-H/16-17) at Qesem Cave allow us to infer a mosaic of open palaeoenvironment with sparse vegetation, shrubland, Mediterranean Forest, rocky areas and riverbanks. Additionally, we infer palaeoclimate from the bioclimatic distribution of extant species using the Coexistence Approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time the approach has been applied to microfaunal assemblages. These data suggest cooler and slightly drier winters and somewhat lower seasonality than at present around Qesem Cave; the differences are more pronounced for the time covered by Concentration 2 than Concentration 1.Among microvertebrates, micromammals are most suitable for biostratigraphic purposes. With the exception of Rattus cf. haasi and the Myomimus judaicus/setzeri group, the small mammal fauna of Qesem Cave comprises only taxa that live today in the Levant. R. haasi and M. judaicus have been found in Israel in the Early and Middle Pleistocene, and their latest known record was from the Acheulian site of Oumm Qatafa. Their presence in Qesem Cave extends the previously known stratigraphic range of these species. The absence of R. haasi in Mousterian sites is thus consistent with the pre-Mousterian age of Qesem Cave. Morphometric data on molars of Guenther's Vole show that the lineage segment preserved in Concentration 2 is more primitive than in Concentration 1, indicating that the former concentration is older. The evolutionary level of the sample from Qesem Concentration 1 is similar to Tabun D (boundary of Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex and Mousterian), and that from Qesem Concentration 2 similar to Tabun Eb (Acheulo-Yabrudian).},

abstract = {Although highly conservative in major lineages, skeletons of tetrapods can vary within groups. In chelonians, a large portion of the skeleton is " external, " which makes it comparatively easy to study. I present several peculiarities in the shape and architecture of shells in the Hermann's tortoise, Testudo hermanni, from five localities in the Balkan Peninsula. These are: a hump in the rear part of the shell (in males), variability in the so-called neural formula (in both sexes), and unusually poorly curved pygal (and supracaudal) element in many males. These oddities were particularly frequent in an insular population, but were found in mainland samples as well. To my knowledge, this study presents the first qualitative and a preliminary quantitative analysis of shell aberrations within and among populations of any Testudo species. More importantly, it was performed on extant populations: this enables monitoring of ontogenetic shell shape development, i.e. the emergence of anomalies, as well as their possible influences and consequences concerning survival and behaviour. Future research should aim at inferring genetic structure within and among Hermann's tortoise populations in the sampled region and in other parts of the Balkans.},

Here we report a phylogenetic reconstruction based on mitochondrial DNA sequences from Gal{\'{a}}pagos tortoises and Geochelone from mainland South America and Africa. The closest living relative to the Gal{\'{a}}pagos tortoise is not among the larger-bodied tortoises of South America but is the relatively small-bodied Geochelone chilensis, or Chaco tortoise. The split between G. chilensis and the Gal{\'{a}}pagos lineage probably occurred 6 to 12 million years ago, before the origin of the oldest extant Gal{\'{a}}pagos island. Our data suggest that the four named southern subspecies on the largest island, Isabela, are not distinct genetic units, whereas a genetically distinct northernmost Isabela subspecies is probably the result of a separate colonization. Most unexpectedly, the lone survivor of the abingdoni subspecies from Pinta Island ("Lonesome George") is very closely related to tortoises from San Cristobal and Espanola, the islands farthest from the island of Pinta. To rule out a possible recent transplant of Lonesome George, we sequenced DNA from three tortoises collected on Pinta in 1906. They have sequences identical to Lonesome George, consistent with his being the last survivor of his subspecies. This finding may provide guidance in finding a mate for Lonesome George, who so far has failed to reproduce.},

The associated fauna, especially the co-occurrence of Choerolophodon and Anancus among the proboscideans, and Cremohipparion matthewi and Hippotherium brachypus among the hipparions, constrains the age of the locality to the second half of the middle Turolian (ca. 7Ma), making it the latest pre-human hominid of continental Europe and Asia Minor. The available morphological and metric data are more similar to those of Ouranopithecus from the Vallesian of Greece than to those of the early to middle Turolian hominids of Turkey and Georgia, but the time gap speaks against a direct phyletic link, and Turolian migration from the east cannot be rejected. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article puts the notion to rest once and for all. Kurtosis tells you virtually nothing about the shape of the peak - its only unambiguous interpretation is in terms of tail extremity; i.e., either existing outliers (for the sample kurtosis) or propensity to produce outliers (for the kurtosis of a probability distribution). To clarify this point, relevant literature is reviewed, counterexample distributions are given, and it is shown that the proportion of the kurtosis that is determined by the central $\mu$ ± $\sigma$ range is usually quite small.},

abstract = {Diversity in biological communities frequently is compared using species accumulation curves, plotting observed species richness versus sample size. When species accumulation curves intersect, the ranking of communities by observed species richness depends on sample size, creating inconsistency in comparisons of diversity. We show that species accumulation curves for two communities are expected to intersect when the community with lower actual species richness has higher Simpson diversity (probability that two random individuals belong to different species). This may often occur when comparing communities that differ in habitat heterogeneity or disturbance, as we illustrate using data from neotropical butterflies. In contrast to observed species richness, estimated Simpson diversity always produces a consistent expected ranking among communities across sample sizes, with the statistical accuracy to confidently rank communities using small samples. Simpson diversity should therefore be particularly useful in rapid assessments to prioritize areas for conservation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} For almost 30 years, paleontologists have analyzed evolutionary sequences in terms of simple null models, most commonly random walks. Despite this long history, there has been little discussion of how model parameters may be estimated from real paleontological data. In this paper, I outline a likelihood-based framework for fitting and comparing models of phyletic evolution. Because of its usefulness and historical importance, I focus on a general form of the random walk model. The long-term dynamics of this model depend on just two parameters: the mean ($\mu$ {\textless}sub{\textgreater}step{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) and variance ($\sigma$ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}step{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) of the distribution of evolutionary transitions (or “steps”). The value of $\mu$ {\textless}sub{\textgreater}step{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} determines the directionality of a sequence, and $\sigma$ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}step{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} governs its volatility. Simulations show that these two parameters can be inferred reliably from paleontological data regardless of how completely the evolving lineage is sampled. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Understanding how species have responded to past climate changes might inform how current climate change may affect species. However, current perspectives on species' response to Quaternary cycles mainly stem from studies on mid and high latitudes and limited information is available at lower latitudes. In these systems a greater variation in individual species' responses to glacial cycles has been suggested, but we lack of clear case studies of such variations. Here, by means of ecological niche modelling, we characterized the niche differentiation of the five subspecies of the tortoise Testudo graeca in north Africa and described the range dynamics suffered by each of the subspecies since the Last Glacial Maxima. Molecular data was employed to infer past population dynamics. The five subspecies present a clear niche differentiation, particularly in relation to rainfall, covering a range from semiarid to humid species. The ecological differentiation among subspecies promotes very different, even opposite, post-glacial range dynamics. Since the Last Glacial Maxima, the ranges have either expanded (T. g. graeca), contracted (T. g. marokkensis), shifted northwards (T. g. soussensis) or remained stable (T. g. cyrenaica and T. g. nabeulensis). Molecular data supported the majority of these range dynamics. Our work exemplifies how, in a climate change scenario, phylogenetically very close taxa (i.e. at the subspecies level) might experience strikingly different biogeographical dynamics due to former niche differentiation. Our work supports an individualistic response to glacial cycles, which can be particularly strong in lower latitudes. In these areas precipitation changes during glacial periods may have strongly affected distribution ranges in idiosyncratic ways. We hypothesize that in those species limited by precipitation the response to glacial cycles (and climate changes) is more unpredictable than in those limited by temperature.},

abstract = {1. Studies on biodiversity and ecosystem function require considering metrics for accurately describing the functional diversity of communities. The number of taxa (richness) is commonly used to characterise biological diversity. The disadvantage of richness as a measure of biological diversity is that all taxa are taken into account on an equal basis regardless of their abundance, their biological characteristics or their function in the ecosystem. 2. To circumvent this problem, we applied a recently described measure of biological diversity that incorporates dissimilarities among taxa. Dissimilarities were defined from biological traits (e.g. life history, morphology, physiology and behaviour) of stream invertebrate taxa and the resulting biological diversity index was considered as a surrogate for functional diversity. 3. As sampling effort is known to affect the number of taxa collected within a reach, we investigated how change in functional diversity is affected by sampling effort. We used stream invertebrate community data from three large European rivers to model accumulation curves and to assess the number of samples required to estimate (i.e. closeness to the maximal value) functional diversity and genera richness. We further evaluated the precision of estimates (i.e. similarity of temporal or spatial replicates) of the total functional diversity. 4. As expected, richness estimates were strongly dependent on sampling effort, and 10 replicate samples were found to underestimate actual richness. Moreover, richness estimates showed much variation with season and location. In contrast, functional diversity had greater accuracy with less sampling effort and the precision of the estimates was higher than richness both across sampling occasions and sampling reaches. These results are further arguments towards conducting research on the design of a biomonitoring tool based on biological traits.},

abstract = {Body size is an important ecological parameter that can be understood in both evolutionary and environmental terms. We present a database of changes in overall body size in brachiopods and trilobites through the Ordovician and earliest Silurian of the Oslo Region, Norway. In contrast with global studies, the limited geographical extent of our data allows correlation with environmental parameters such as climate and water depth, and simplifies taxonomical standardization and stratigraphical correlation. In our data set there is a clear indication of increasing size both for brachiopods and trilobites during most of the Ordovician, although this could result from an unbiased random walk. The size increase is followed by a reduction in size during the latest Ordovician. Trilobites show a strong increase followed by a decrease in body size during the Middle Ordovician, while brachiopod body size peaks later, in the Late Ordovician. These changes are partly correlated with the changes in species diversity in the Oslo Region. We discuss the results in terms of two models for change in body size - Cope's rule and the Lilliput effect. Cope's rule is the theory of an increasing body size through geological time, while the Lilliput effect describes a decrease in body size in the aftermath of a mass extinction or a severe environmental disturbance. We find no clear correlations between body size and sea level.},

abstract = {The archaeo-palaeontological sites studed in this work, are well as their ages, are indicated in the French version (fig. 1 and 2). Squamate faunas: During the first half of the Middle Pliocene (Late Ruscinian, Biozone MN 15 and MN15/MN16 boundary), at least 13 squamate families are present (tab. 1). The fauna is similar to that from the Miocene, although becoming slightly impoverished but still retaining a tropical character, as shown by the presence of Varanidae, Aniliidae s.1. and Elapidae. Today, these families inhabit tropical areas and their northern boundary is essentially situated between the 20°C and 25°C mean annual temperature isotherms (fig. 3). The great majority of modern representatives of these families basically live in arid or semi-desert regions. Nevertheless, such an arid character is somewhat mitigate in the South-East of France by the presence of some amphibian species confined to humid and aquatic environments. During the second half of the Middle Pliocene (Early Vyllanian, Biozone MN 16), the squamate fauna becomes more impoverished (only 9 families, fig. 4)) and more thermophilous families disappear (tab. 2). Only families that are still currently present in the Mediterranean area and whose northern boundary is situated between the 15°C and 20°C mean annual temperature isotherms persist (fig. 3). The arid character of the climatic seems to be increasing. During the Late Pliocene (Late Vyllanian, MN 17, tab. 3, fig. 4), scolecophidian snakes, some Gekkonidae different from the current species, the Scincid Mabuya, and oriental vipers no longer live in the region, whereas other thermophilous groups (Agamidae, Blanidae and some Colubridae) are affected by a southward withdrawal. At the same time, some species coming from Central Europe arrive in France (fig. 4). Apparently, the establishment of the present fauna take place during the Early Pleistocene (tab. 4 and fig. 4). At that time, exotic family (Agamidae) is no longer present and the last Ophisaurus (Anguidae) has found refuge, before final local disappearance, in the South of the Iberian Peninsula (Barranco Le{\'{o}}n 5 and Fuente Nueva 3). Climatic data (fig. 6): During the first half of the Middle Pliocene, some families with unquestionable tropical tendencies are well represented. The climate may still have hold some tropical character (mean annual temperature {\textgreater} 20°C with a poor contrasting seasonality) and aridity. During the second half of the Middle Pliocene, the families with basically tropical affinities are no longer represented. This faunal scarcity seems to point out a significant climatic degradation, with a decrease of the temperature (mean annual temperature {\textless} 20°C) and the establishment of a climate with contrasted seasons (probably of Mediterranean type). At the same time, the aridity seems to increase. During the Late Pliocene, the drop in temperature becomes more pronounced and some Centro-European species arrive in France. The mean annual temperature do as not seem to exceed 15°C at Montouss{\'{e}} 5, 16°C at Vallirana and 18°C at Casablanca-Almenara 3. The Early Pleistocene seems to begin with cooler climatic conditions. The disappearance of the last Agamidae corresponds to a fall of the mean annual temperature below 15°C.},

@article{Hofmeyr2016,
abstract = {Africa, inclusive of the West Indian Ocean islands, harbours 11 of the world's 16 extant testudinid genera. Fossil records indicate that testudinids originated in Asia and dispersed first to North America and Europe (Early Eocene) and later to Africa (Late Eocene). We used mitochondrial (1870 bp) and nuclear (1416 bp) DNA sequence data to assess whether molecular data support the late cladogenesis of Southern African testudinid lineages. Our results revealed strong support for the monophyly of a clade consisting of Kinixys, the two Malagasy genera and four Southern African genera (Psammobates, Stigmochelys, Homopus and Chersina). Kinixys diverged from this clade in the Late Palaeocene, suggesting that testudinids occupied Africa at an earlier date than indicated by fossil records. The Southern African tortoises consist of three, strongly supported clades: Psammobates + Stigmochelys; the five-toed Homopus + Chersina; and the four-toed Homopus. Due to the paraphyly of Homopus, we propose the taxonomic resurrection of Chersobius for the five-toed Homopus species (boulengeri, signatus and solus). Cladogenesis at the genus level occurred mainly in the Eocene, with Chersina and Chersobius diverging in the Oligocene. The latter divergence coincided with species-level radiations within Homopus (areolatus and femoralis) and Psammobates (oculifer, geometricus and tentorius). Our phylogeny could not resolve relationships within Psammobates, indicating rapid speciation between the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene. The Chersobius species were the last to diverge in the Early to Mid-Miocene. By the Mid-Miocene, P. tentorius started to differentiate into four lineages instead of the three recognized subspecies: P. t. tentorius, P. t. trimeni and two P. t. verroxii subclades occurring north and south of the Orange River, respectively. Terminal radiations in several taxa suggest the existence of cryptic species and a more diverse tortoise fauna than currently recognized. Factors contributing to this diversity may include the early origin of African testudinids and climatic fluctuations over a heterogeneous landscape.},

abstract = {As a significant tool in ecological studies, the species accumulation curve or the collector's curve is the graph of the expected number of detected species as a function of sampling effort. The problem of estimating the species accumulation curve based on an empirical data set arising from quadrat sampling is studied in a nonparametric binomial mixture model. It will be shown that estimating the species accumulation curve not only is independent of the unknown number of species but also includes estimating the number of species as a limiting case. For the purpose of interpolation, moment-based estimators, associated with asymptotic confidence intervals, are developed from several points of view. A likelihood-based procedure is developed for the purpose of extrapolation, associated with bootstrap confidence intervals. The proposed methods are illustrated by ecological data sets.},

abstract = {During the Cretaceous, non-marine turtles show strong patterns of provincialism, mirroring the pattern of land masses resulting from the breakup of Pangea since the Jurassic. These patterns are a result of several factors, of which vicariancy and ecological controls on the distribution of groups of turtles are considered the most significant. The large scale patterns, such as the dominance of pleurodires in the southern land masses, including Africa, South America, and India, and the dominance of Cryptodires in the northern land masses cannot be strictly attributed to vicariancy because exceptions to both distributional patterns are present. The pleurodires in Europe and North America during the Late Cretaceous may reflect the removal of the barriers that prevented the terrestrial faunal interchange between the northern and southern continents. Two groups of cryptodires that occurred in the southern continents during the Cretaceous, the Meiolaniidae and Otwayemys, seem to reflect a widespread distribution of the very primitive cryptodires which were diverse prior to the breakup of Pangea in the Early or possibly Middle Jurassic. In Laurasia, three regions of turtle diversity can be identified, the North American region, the European region, and the Asian region. In the Early Cretaceous, North American region is dominated by members of the Paracryptodira, and the Asian region is dominated by members of the Eucryptodira. Europe includes taxa from both groups. In the Late Cretaceous, Eucryptodires become increasingly more abundant and diverse in North America. The Baenidae which are not found outside North America appears to be truly endemic to this region. Two groups of “modern,” non-marine cryptodires or Chelomacryptodira, the Testudinoidea and the Trionychoidea, appear to have an Asian origin. Both have their earliest record in the Neocomian of Japan.Keywords: non-marine turtles, Cretaceous, phylogeny, distribution, Gondwana, Laurasia.},

abstract = {Recent stratigraphic subdivision of the Pleistocene of Poland presents 4 complexes: Pre-glacial, South-Polish, Middle-Polish and North-Polish ones. Each complex comprises a set of strati-graphic units, corresponding to the previously distinguished 8 glaciations/coolings and 7 intergla-cials/warmings. Three younger complexes and corresponding extents of Scandinavian ice sheets in Poland are described in more detail. Three older interglacials in Poland (Augustovian, Kozi Grzbiet and Ferdynandovian) are characteristic for their bi-optimal climatic sequences but so far, they have no equivalents in loess sections of the Volhynian Upland in the Ukraine. Coolings between the optima of these interglacials are occasionally considered as small glaciations, during which the ice sheet could occupy only a northern part of Poland. All younger interglacials are mono-optimal in Poland and as such, they are also reflected by single palaeosols in loess sections of both countries. Till occurrences in key loess sections of Poland and Ukraine enabled precise delimitation of ice sheet extents, espe-cially within the Middle-Polish Complex with the glaciations Liwiecian, Krznanian and Odranian as-cribed to OIS 10, 8 and 6, respectively. During the youngest (Vistulian, Valdai) Glaciation, 3-4 loess deposits were formed in the Lublin and Volhynian Uplands; they are separated by palaeosols that de-veloped during interstadial-rank warmings.},

abstract = {Tortoises are one of the most common faunal components at many Palaeolithic archaeological sites across the Old World. They provide protein, fat, and other 'animal' resources in a 'collectable' package. However, for most sites their interpretation as human food debris is based only on association, rather than demonstrated through taphonomic analysis. Because of their very different anatomical configuration compared to mammals, it is difficult to conduct such analyses by directly applying the taphonomic methods used to interpret large mammal assemblages. Tortoise-specific taphonomic analysis is presented here for the Still Bay layers at the important Middle Stone Age (MSA) site of Blombos Cave (BBC), Western Cape, South Africa. Research on MSA subsistence systems at sites such as BBC has almost exclusively relied on analysis of large ungulate remains, in spite of the fact that many of these key sites contain equal or greater numbers of tortoise fragments. In this analysis we show that human modification is common on the BBC tortoises, and that there are consistent patterns of fragmentation and burning that indicate set processing sequences including cooking while in the shell, hammerstone percussion, and human chewing of limbs. The almost exclusive dominance of the angulate tortoise, Chersina angulata, is confirmed by full skeletal element analyses rather than only counts of single elements such as humeri. The sex distribution can be reconstructed for this species, and is female-biased. For all tortoise assemblages, taxonomic and skeletal element abundance data should be calculated from a sample of complete elements, or at minimum the entoplastron and humerus. A sample of shell and limb/girdle elements should also be subjected to microscopic bone surface modification analysis, as modifications are often rare or subtle but highly informative. Using this approach, analysis of breakage patterns, bone surface modification, and burning patterns can be understood together to specifically reconstruct tortoise collection, processing, and human dietary significance across a range of archaeological sites. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rodrigues Island in the western Indian Ocean had the highest density of giant tortoises known in historic times. The two endemic tortoise species (Cylindraspis vosmaeri and C. peltastes) provided vital ecosystem services for the endemic flora. By 1795 they had been rendered extinct as a result of commercial exploitation. In 2006, a private protected area, the Fran{\c{c}}ois Leguat Giant Tortoise and Cave Reserve, was established on Rodrigues with the aim of introducing two species of tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea from the Seychelles and Astrochelys radiata from Madagascar) as ecological analogues to replace the extinct species, as well as re-establishing the native endemic habitat. Since then over 600 tortoises have been released and 186,000 endemic and native trees have been re-planted. Such ecosystem reconstruction using analogues is known as ‘re-wilding', and appears preliminarily to be working on Rodrigues. The program could potentially serve as a model for re-wilding of giant tortoises to Madagascar by using Aldabrachelys gigantea as an analogue for the extinct Aldabrachelys abrupta.},

Its morphology is sufficiently well preserved to allow assignment to the extinct North American genus Hesperotestudo. However, several features of this tortoise are unique and it is named Hesperotestudo bermudae sp. nov. A review of the phylogenetic relationships of the better known genera of the Testudinidae suggests that the affinities of Hesperotestudo lie with other North American tortoises (Gopherus) and not with Geochelone or other testudinines; thus, Hesperotestudo is reassigned to the Xerobatinae. This is at least the fifth documentation of a testudinid dispersing over open ocean to an oceanic island (the first for Hesperotestudo) and it corroborates the hypothesis that members of this family are well suited to over-water dispersal.},

abstract = {The presence of remains of a giant tortoise in the lower Pleistocene site of Fonelas P-1 (Guadix Basin, Betic Ranges; Granada, southeastern Spain) is reported and analyzed herein for the first time. This finding represents the youngest evidence of a large tortoise in continental Europe, dating the age of extinction of this successful lineage as several hundred thousand years younger than previously thought. So far, the most recent record known for continental Europe was at least 400,000 years older than the occurrence reported herein (Vater{\'{a}}, Greece), that for the Spanish record being about 1.3 million years older (Las Higueruelas). This finding is justified as the youngest evidence of Titanochelon, a genus recorded in Europe since the beginning of the Miocene, which includes the largest terrestrial turtles known for the entire European fossil record. The decrease in the biogeographical distribution area and the final extinction of these temperature-sensitive animals in Europe is here recognized as a result of the climate changes documented during the Pliocene and lower Pleistocene. The identification of taxa with environmental and ecological requirements as restrictive as those known for the extant and extinct large tortoises, living in continental Europe 2.0 Ma, has important consequences. Thus, although the paleoclimatic inferences generally assumed for the whole of Europe interpret cooler and drier conditions at the end of the Pliocene, by the increase of the seasonality and the beginning of the glacial activity in the Northern Hemisphere, the record of Fonelas P-1 indicates that, in southern Europe or, at least, in the endorheic basins of the Betic Ranges, warmer climatic conditions than in the rest of the continent continued being present in these chronologies of the lower Pleistocene, being favorable for the persistence of these large tortoises.},

How best to interpret this record has been controversial, but empirical and methodological advances have resolved at least two issues about pattern: (a) directional transformations are seldom sustained over geological timescales, and (b) net rates of morphological change in fossil species are usually quite slow. Considerable uncertainty remains, however, about the processes responsible for these patterns, but most fruitful explanations use the framework of adaptive landscapes to consider the role of natural selection and other processes. An additional, unresolved issue is the claim that most phenotypic change is associated with speciation. A variety of methods, using data from both fossil and extant species, have supported such a link, at least in some clades and traits, but its prevalence and underlying mechanism remain unresolved.},

Additionally, non-mature specimens may be problematic to differentiate. To further quantify the identification of two genera of large Pleistocene tortoises, nuchal and neural bones (n = 58) from the collection sites in South Texas were examined and measured. Scatter plots, based on length, width and thickness measurements and ratios were developed for both nuchal and neural elements. The analysis supports the ability to differentiate between large species of late Pleistocene tortoises (Hesperotestudo and Gopherus) from South Texas based not only on diagnostic descriptions but also by different suites of measurements. These measurements and ratios may also be useful for identification and separation of additional genera/species of tortoises throughout North America, both extinct and extant.},

This check-list complements the broader listing of all modern and extant turtles and tortoises by the Turtle Taxonomy Working Group (2014). We provide a comprehensive listing of taxonomy, names, synonymies, and stratigraphic distribution of all chelonian taxa that have gone extinct from ap-proximately the boundary between the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene, ca. 2.6 million years ago, up through 1500 AD, at the beginning of modern times. We also provide details on modern turtle and tortoise taxa that have gone extinct since 1500 AD. This checklist currently includes 100 fossil turtle and tortoise taxa, including 84 named and apparently distinct species, and 16 ad-ditional taxa that appear to represent additional valid species, but are only identified to genus or family. Modern extinct turtles and tortoises include 8 species, 3 subspecies, and 1 unnamed taxon, for 12 taxa. Of the extinct fossil taxa, terrestrial tortoises of the family Testudinidae (including many large-bodied island forms) are the most numerous, with 60 taxa. When the numbers for fossil tortoises are combined with the 61 modern (living and extinct) species of tortoises, of the 121 tortoise species that have existed at some point since the beginning of the Pleistocene, 69 (57.0{\%}) have gone extinct.

abstract = {The late Quaternary megafauna extinction was a severe global-scale event. Two factors, climate change and modern humans, have received broad support as the primary drivers, but their absolute and relative importance remains controversial. To date, focus has been on the extinction chronology of individual or small groups of species, specific geographical regions or macroscale studies at very coarse geographical and taxonomic resolution, limiting the possibility of adequately testing the proposed hypotheses. We present, to our knowledge, the first global analysis of this extinction based on comprehensive country-level data on the geographical distribution of all large mammal species (more than or equal to 10 kg) that have gone globally or continentally extinct between the beginning of the Last Interglacial at 132 000 years BP and the late Holocene 1000 years BP, testing the relative roles played by glacial-interglacial climate change and humans. We show that the severity of extinction is strongly tied to hominin palaeobiogeography, with at most a weak, Eurasia-specific link to climate change. This first species-level macroscale analysis at relatively high geographical resolution provides strong support for modern humans as the primary driver of the worldwide megafauna losses during the late Quaternary.},

Thanks to still unpublished material, T. lunellensis is diagnosed for the first time and its shell morphology described in detail. This species is uniquely characterized, among others, by tall peripheral bones and by a peculiar shape of the anterior lobe of the plastron, somewhat recalling the species referred to Testudo s.s.

Given that the purported valid species from Lunel-Viel (Middle Pleistocene, France) is still unnamed and undescribed, T. lunellensis from Cova de Gr{\`{a}}cia is currently the stratigraphically youngest extinct Testudo species. The co-occurrence in T. lunellensis of characters typical of both T. hermanni and Testudo s.s. further testifies the phenotypic plasticity of tortoises and the mosaic distribution of morphological characters, which hinders a clear-cut assessment of the relationships of extant tortoises when based exclusively on morphology. Further analyses of the phylogeny of Testudo should consider fossil and extant taxa together, as well as both morphological and genetic characters. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.},

abstract = {The climatic cycles of the Quaternary, during which global mean annual temperatures have regularly changed by 5-10°C, provide a special opportunity for studying the rate, magnitude, and effects of geographic responses to changing climates. During the Quaternary, high- and mid-latitude species were extirpated from regions that were covered by ice or otherwise became unsuitable, persisting in refugial retreats where the environment was compatible with their tolerances. In this study we combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles). These paleophylogeographic models indicate the areas where past climates were compatible with the modern ranges of the species and serve as hypotheses for how their geographic ranges would have changed in response to Quaternary climate cycles. We test these hypotheses against physiological, genetic, taxonomic and fossil evidence, and we then use them to measure the effects of Quaternary climate cycles on species distributions. Patterns of range expansion, contraction, and fragmentation in the models are strongly congruent with (i) phylogeographic differentiation; (ii) morphological variation; (iii) physiological tolerances; and (iv) intraspecific genetic variability. Modern species with significant interspecific differentiation have geographic ranges that strongly fluctuated and repeatedly fragmented throughout the Quaternary. Modern species with low genetic diversity have geographic distributions that were highly variable and at times exceedingly small in the past. Our results reveal the potential for paleophylogeographic models to (i) reconstruct past geographic range modifications, (ii) identify geographic processes that result in genetic bottlenecks; and (iii) predict threats due to anthropogenic climate change in the future.},

Several specimens of chelonians have also been discovered and comprise a small testudinid, a geoemydid and a giant tortoise. The presence of a giant tortoise and the presence of a geoemydid with large dimensions are further examples of the trend towards gigantism evidenced by the diverse fauna of Milia. In terms of taxonomic abundance of extinct turtles, this is the richest locality in Greece. The small testudinid is of particular importance because it preserves a posteriorly flared carapace, as in the extant Testudo marginata, but the posterior carapace is much taller and anteroposteriorly shorter. These characters allow us to erect a new species, Testudo brevitesta sp. nov., and to discuss the presence of the marginated tortoise and closely related forms in Greece. The new taxon is analysed in a phylogenetic context within other extant and extinct testudinids, providing new information on the clade Testudona.},

Here we estimate the diversity of nonavian dinosaurs at approximately 1,850 genera, including those that remain to be discovered. With 527 genera currently described, at least 71{\%} of dinosaur genera thus remain unknown. Although known diversity declined in the last stage of the Cretaceous, estimated diversity was steady, suggesting that dinosaurs as a whole were not in decline in the 10 million years before their ultimate extinction. We also show that known diversity is biased by the availability of fossiliferous rock outcrop. Finally, by using a logistic model, we predict that 75{\%} of discoverable genera will be known within 60-100 years and 90{\%} within 100-140 years. Because of nonrandom factors affecting the process of fossil discovery (which preclude the possibility of computing realistic confidence bounds), our estimate of diversity is likely to be a lower bound.},

Germany is a well-known fossil lagerst??tte with exceptionally preserved fossils, particularly insects and plants, which thrived in and around the maar lake during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (late Early/early Middle Miocene, mammal zone MN5). We provide the first critical and detailed overview of the fauna and flora with lists of 363 previously published, partially revised, and newly identified taxa. Plant remains are the most diverse group (168 taxa), followed by insects (79). The flora points towards subhumid sclerophyllous forests and mixed mesophytic forests, the former being an indication for the occurrence of seasonal drought. Three main sections can be differentiated for the habitats of the Randeck Maar lake system: (1) Deep- and open-water lake habitats with local and short-termed mass occurrences of insect larvae, amphibians, and/or gastropods, while fish is particularly scarce. The interpretation of the water chemistry is problematic because contradictive palaeoenvironmental indicators for both brackish and freshwater conditions exist. (2) Shallow parts of the lake comprise a narrow reed-belt with insects and gastropods living on the exposed plant stems as well as turtles. (3) Crater slopes and surrounding plateaus were mainly covered by subhumid sclerophyllous to mixed mesophytic forests depending on sun exposition and soil conditions. Horses and other forest-dwellers preferably lived in forested habitats while proboscideans and rhinoceratids occupied more open habitats.

abstract = {Dietary reconstructions can offer an improved perspective on human capacities of adaptation to the environment. New methodological approaches and analytical techniques have led to a theoretical framework for understanding how human groups used and adapted to their local environment. Faunal remains provide an important potential source of dietary information and allow study of behavioural variation and its evolutionary significance. Interest in determining how hominids filled the gaps in large prey availability with small game or what role small game played in pre-Upper Palaeolithic societies is an area of active research. Some of this work has focused on tortoises because they represent an important combination of edible and non-edible resources that are easy to collect if available. The exploitation of these slow-moving animals features prominently in prey choice models because the low handling costs of these reptiles make up for their small body size. Here, we present new taphonomic data from two tortoise assemblages extracted from the lower sequence of the Middle Pleistocene site of Qesem Cave, Israel (420-300 ka), with the aim of assessing the socio-economic factors that may have led to the inclusion of this type of resource in the human diets. We show that hominid damage on large tortoise specimens from Qesem Cave is not unusual and that evidence such as cut marks, percussion marks and consistent patterns of burning suggests established sequences of processing, including cooking in the shell, defleshing, and direct percussion to access the visceral content. These matters make it possible not only to assess the potential role of tortoises as prey, but also to evaluate collecting behaviour in the resource acquisition systems and eco-social strategies at the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) in the southern Levant.},

abstract = {We used a five-gene data set (mtDNA: 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, cyt-b; nDNA: Cmos, Rag2) comprising approximately two-thirds of all extant testudinid species and, for the first time, including all five Testudo species to investigate the question of whether all western Palaearctic testudinids are monophyletic. Further, we examined whether the recently suggested allocation of the African Geochelone pardalis in the otherwise exclusively South African genus Psammobates and of the Malagasy G. yniphora in the monotypic genus Angonoka is justified in the face of considerable morphological evidence against such placements. Our phylogenetic analyses do not support the paraphyly and generic break-up of Testudo, as suggested by previous papers using a smaller taxon sampling and mtDNA data only. We propose a continued usage of the generic name Testudo for all five western Palaearctic tortoise species. Within Testudo, two monophyletic subclades are present, one containing T. hermanni+T. horsfieldii, and the other comprising (T. kleinmanni+T. marginata)+T. graeca. Nomenclaturally, we demonstrate that Eurotestudo Lapparent de Broin et al., 2006, which was recently erected with the type species T. hermanni, is an objective junior synonym of Chersine Merrem, 1820 and Medaestia Wussow, 1916. Recognition of a monotypic genus Angonoka for G. yniphora is unwarranted according to both our re-analysis of sequence data and morphological data. Acknowledging the strong morphological similarity between G. yniphora and G. radiata, we suggest placing both species into the genus Astrochelys. Although sequence data for only one of the three Psammobates species was available for analysis, there is currently no cause to challenge the monophyly of this genus as established on the basis of morphological evidence. Thus, we hypothesize that G. pardalis is sister to a monophyletic Psammobates. In light of the clear morphological gap between G. pardalis and Psammobates species, the recognition of a distinct genus Stigmochelys for the former seems justified. ?? 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {The general properties of the orbiviruses have been examined at the physical, structural and molecular level. At the structural level, the orbiviruses (with the exception of the Kemerovo serogroup) appear similar. The replicative events are also similar, however differences in the ultrastructure of virus-specific structures and their association with components of the host cell have been observed. Further research in this area may be used to differentiate between the serogroups and even some serotypes, of orbiviruses. At the molecular level the properties of the genome can be used to determine relationships between members of the orbivirus genus. These relationships are revealed using a variety of techniques including serology and gene sequence analysis. Not only are the different serological responses to gene products present in the mature virus particle used for differential diagnosis, but the gene sequences themselves can also be utilized. Understanding of the relationships between these viruses is progressing to the point that insights into orbivirus molecular epidemiology is now possible. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The extinctions of keystone megafauna during the Pleistocene and Holocene continue to affect extant species and ecosystems. This is particularly acute in southern and western Madagascar where two now extinct species of giant tortoises were once amongst the most dominant herbivores. The extinct giant tortoises are likely to have influenced ecosystem processes by being effective dispersers of large seeds, keeping the understorey open, cycling nutrients, and indirectly regulating fire regimes. As a result of their extinction, ecological interactions and ecosystems have been altered. Given that there is evidence that the extant Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, is closely related to at least one of these Madagascan giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys abrupta, we propose using captive Aldabran giant tortoises to restore missing ecological functions. This ambitious approach will represent the first continental island restoration project with a surviving lineage of now extinct, endemic megafauna. Translocation of this megafauna species could be a pragmatic and cost-effective tool to contribute to halting the ongoing extinction processes in parts of western and southern Madagascar, and would further understanding of the role of these species in pre-human Madagascan ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The presence of remains of a giant tortoise in the lower Pleistocene site of Fonelas P-1 (Guadix Basin, Betic Ranges; Granada, southeastern Spain) is reported and analyzed herein for the first time. This finding represents the youngest evidence of a large tortoise in continental Europe, dating the age of extinction of this successful lineage as several hundred thousand years younger than previously thought. So far, the most recent record known for continental Europe was at least 400,000 years older than the occurrence reported herein (Vater{\'{a}}, Greece), that for the Spanish record being about 1.3 million years older (Las Higueruelas). This finding is justified as the youngest evidence of Titanochelon, a genus recorded in Europe since the beginning of the Miocene, which includes the largest terrestrial turtles known for the entire European fossil record. The decrease in the biogeographical distribution area and the final extinction of these temperature-sensitive animals in Europe is here recognized as a result of the climate changes documented during the Pliocene and lower Pleistocene. The identification of taxa with environmental and ecological requirements as restrictive as those known for the extant and extinct large tortoises, living in continental Europe 2.0 Ma, has important consequences. Thus, although the paleoclimatic inferences generally assumed for the whole of Europe interpret cooler and drier conditions at the end of the Pliocene, by the increase of the seasonality and the beginning of the glacial activity in the Northern Hemisphere, the record of Fonelas P-1 indicates that, in southern Europe or, at least, in the endorheic basins of the Betic Ranges, warmer climatic conditions than in the rest of the continent continued being present in these chronologies of the lower Pleistocene, being favorable for the persistence of these large tortoises.},

abstract = {Dmanisi is currently the oldest Early Palaeolithic site discovered out of Africa. It has produced over 40 hominin remains, including a set of very informative skulls, in direct association with faunal remains and numerous lithic artifacts. Given the relevance of this locality, every effort is being made to reconstruct the landscapes where these hominins once lived. Amphibian and reptile remains from Dmanisi are here described for the first time and used as paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental proxies. They comprise at least six taxa: a green toad (. Bufo gr. Bufo viridis), the Greek tortoise (. Testudo graeca), a green lizard (. Lacerta gr. Lacerta viridis), a four-lined snake (. Elaphe gr. Elaphe quatuorlineata), an indeterminate colubrid and a water snake (. Natrix sp.). As these taxa are not extinct and their ecology can be directly studied, they can contribute to the reconstruction of the landscape and climate. The application of the Mutual Climatic Range method provides quantitative data indicating that during the hominin presence at Dmanisi climate was warm and dry, similar to the present-day Mediterranean climate. In comparison with today climate of Dmanisi, estimated mean annual temperature was 3.1°C higher, with a greater increase of temperature in summer (+7.1°C) than in winter (+4.7°C). The mean annual precipitation was slightly lower (-65mm) than the current level, with precipitation higher than current one during winter (+104mm) but strongly lower during the other seasons, suggesting a stronger contrast in the rainfall regime during the year. From a paleoenvironmental point of view, fossil amphibians and reptiles all suggest the predominance of arid environments, from steppe or semi-desert to open Mediterranean forest, with stony or rocky substrate and bushy areas. The presence of permanent aquatic environments is also documented. These results mainly agree with those for large mammals, small mammals and the archaeobotanical analysis that indicate an important water stress suggesting a period of increased aridity contemporaneous with human occupations of the site.},

abstract = {Abstract: Nearly half the world's vascular plant species and one-third of terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to 25 “hotspots” of biodiversity, each of which has at least 1500 endemic plant species. None of these hotspots have more than one-third of their pristine habitat remaining. Historically, they covered 12{\%} of the land's surface, but today their intact habitat covers only 1.4{\%} of the land. As a result of this habitat loss, we expect many of the hotspot endemics to have either become extinct or—because much of the habitat loss is recent—to be threatened with extinction. We used World Conservation Union [ IUCN ] Red Lists to test this expectation. Overall, between one-half and two-thirds of all threatened plants and 57{\%} of all threatened terrestrial vertebrates are hotspot endemics. For birds and mammals, in general, predictions of extinction in the hotspots based on habitat loss match numbers of species independently judged extinct or threatened. In two classes of hotspots the match is not as close. On oceanic islands, habitat loss underestimates extinction because introduced species have driven extinctions beyond those caused by habitat loss on these islands. In large hotspots, conversely, habitat loss overestimates extinction, suggesting scale dependence (this effect is also apparent for plants). For reptiles, amphibians, and plants, many fewer hotspot endemics are considered threatened or extinct than we would expect based on habitat loss. This mismatch is small in temperate hotspots, however, suggesting that many threatened endemic species in the poorly known tropical hotspots have yet to be included on the IUCN Red Lists. We then asked in which hotspots the consequences of further habitat loss (either absolute or given current rates of deforestation) would be most serious. Our results suggest that the Eastern Arc and Coastal Forests of Tanzania-Kenya, Philippines, and Polynesia-Micronesia can least afford to lose more habitat and that, if current deforestation rates continue, the Caribbean, Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, Sundaland, Indo-Burma, Madagascar, and Choc{\'{o}}–Dari{\'{e}}n–Western Ecuador will lose the most species in the near future. Without urgent conservation intervention, we face mass extinctions in the hotspots. Resumen: Casi la mitad del total de plantas vasculares del mundo y un tercio de los vertebrados terrestres son end{\'{e}}micos en 25 “{\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas” para la biodiversidad, cada una de las cuales tiene por lo menos 1500 especies de plantas end{\'{e}}micas. En ninguno de estos sitios permanece m{\'{a}}s de un tercio de su h{\'{a}}bitat pr{\'{i}}stino. Hist{\'{o}}ricamente, cubr{\'{i}}an 12{\%} de la superficie terrestre, pero en la actualidad su h{\'{a}}bitat intacto cubre solo 1.4{\%} del terreno. Como resultado de esta p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat esperamos que muchas de las especies end{\'{e}}micas a estos sitios est{\'{e}}n extintas o – porque la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat es reciente – se encuentren amenazadas de extinci{\'{o}}n. Utilizamos Listas Rojas de UICN para comprobar esta predicci{\'{o}}n. En general, entre la mitad y dos tercios de las plantas amenazadas y el 57{\%} de los vertebrados terrestres amenazados son end{\'{e}}micos de {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad. Para aves y mam{\'{i}}feros en general, las predicciones de extinci{\'{o}}n en las {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad, basadas en la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat, coinciden con el n{\'{u}}mero de especies consideradas extintas o amenazadas independientemente. En dos clases de {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad la coincidencia no es muy grande. En islas oce{\'{a}}nicas, la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat subestima la extinci{\'{o}}n porque las especies introducidas han causado m{\'{a}}s extinciones que las producidas por la reducci{\'{o}}n del h{\'{a}}bitat. Por lo contrario, la p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat sobrestima la extinci{\'{o}}n en {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad extensas, lo que sugiere una dependencia de escala (este efecto tambi{\'{e}}n es aparente para plantas). Para reptiles, anfibios y plantas mucho menos especies end{\'{e}}micas son consideradas amenazadas o extintas por p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat. Sin embargo, esta discordancia es peque{\~{n}}a en {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad en zonas templadas templadas, lo que sugiere que muchas especies end{\'{e}}micas amenazadas en las poco conocidas {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad en zonas tropicales aun est{\'{a}}n por incluirse en las Listas Rojas. Posteriormente nos preguntamos en que {\'{a}}reas cr{\'{i}}ticas para la biodiversidad ser{\'{i}}an m{\'{a}}s serias las consecuencias de una mayor p{\'{e}}rdida de h{\'{a}}bitat (absoluta o con las tasas actuales de deforestaci{\'{o}}n). Nuestros resultados sugieren que el Arco Oriental y los Bosques Costeros de Tanzania/Kenia, Filipinas, Polinesia/Micronesia no pueden soportar mayores p{\'{e}}rdidas y que, si contin{\'{u}}an las tasas de deforestaci{\'{o}}n actuales, el Caribe, Andes Tropicales, Filipinas, Mesoam{\'{e}}rica, Sundaland, Indo-Burma, Madagascar y Choc{\'{o}}/Dari{\'{e}}n/Ecuador Occidental perder{\'{a}}n m{\'{a}}s especies en el futuro.

abstract = {Ecologists have traditionally viewed the total species diversity within a set of communities as the product of the average diversity within a community (alpha) and the diversity among the communities (beta). This multiplicative concept of species diversity contrasts with the lesser known idea that alpha- and beta-diversities sum to give the total diversity. This additive partitioning of species diversity is nearly as old as the multiplicative concept, yet ecologists are just now beginning to use additive partitioning to examine patterns of species diversity. In this review we discuss why additive partitioning remained "hidden" until just a few years ago. The rediscovery of additive partitioning has expanded the way in which ecologists define and measure beta-diversity. Beta diversity is no longer relegated to describing change only along all environmental gradient. Through additive partitioning, beta-diversity is explicitly an average amount of diversity just as is a-diversity. We believe that the additive partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components will continue to become more widely used because it allows for a direct comparison of alpha- and beta-diversities. It also has particular relevance for testing ecological theory concerned with the determinants of species diversity at multiple spatial scales and potential applications ill conservation biology.},

abstract = {We analysed field-collected quantitative data of benthic marine molluscs across the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary in Patagonia to identify patterns and processes of biodiversity reconstruction after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. We contrast diversity dynamics from nearshore environments with those from offshore environments. In both settings, Early Palaeogene (Danian) assemblages are strongly dominated by surviving lineages, many of which changed their relative abundance from being rare before the extinction event to becoming the new dominant forms. Only a few of the species in the Danian assemblages were newly evolved. In offshore environments, however, two newly evolved Danian bivalve species attained ecological dominance by replacing two ecologically equivalent species that disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous. In both settings, the total number of Danian genera at a locality remained below the total number of late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) genera at that locality. We suggest that biotic interactions, in particular incumbency effects, suppressed post-extinction diversity and prevented the compensation of diversity loss by originating and invading taxa. Contrary to the total number of genera at localities, diversity at the level of individual fossiliferous horizons before and after the boundary is indistinguishable in offshore environments. This indicates an evolutionary rapid rebound to pre-extinction values within less than ca 0.5 million years. In nearshore environments, by contrast, diversity of fossiliferous horizons was reduced in the Danian, and this lowered diversity lasted for the entire studied post-extinction interval. In this heterogeneous environment, low connectivity among populations may have retarded the recolonisation of nearshore habitats by survivors.},

abstract = {An extensive study of the comparative osteology of turkeys (Aves: Meleagrididae) confirms the validity of the extinct California Turkey, Meleagris californica. The study included all major and many minor skeletal elements of adult specimens of M. californica, best known from the asphalt deposits at Rancho La Brea, California, and both species of extant turkeys: Meleagris gallopavo and Meleagris ocellata. The study also confirmed that M. californica is more closely related to M. gallopavo than to M. ocellata. A review of turkey remains from localities other than Rancho La Brea confirmed the presence of M. californica in California within a relatively small geographic range extending from Orange County in the south, through Los Angeles County, to Santa Barbara County in the north. Other, unconfirmed records of fossil turkeys in the western United States suggest that the species might have been more widespread. Based on a unique combination of characters, we confirmed the presence of Meleagris crassipes in Howells Ridge Cave, Grant County, New Mexico, which indicates that the geographic range of this extinct species extended from northeastern Mexico (San Josecito Cave) to at least New Mexico in the late Pleistocene. The close osteological similarity between M. californica and M. gallopavo suggests that the ancestors of M. californica became isolated in California only after nearing the M. gallopavo grade, but certain osteological features suggest different adaptations in the two species following divergence of their respective lineages. The high incidence of entrapment in the La Brea asphalt seeps is linked to the species social behavior. The end Pleistocene extinction of M. californica might have resulted from the coincidental occurrence of two factors: a dramatic drop of precipitation to well below modern precipitation levels beginning about 11,500 BP, which would have concentrated local populations of turkeys around limited roost sites and water supplies, and the arrival of paleoindians in California, who might have hunted the concentrated birds to extinction.},

abstract = {Tukey's multiple comparison test is one of several tests that can be used to determine which means amongst a set of means differ from the rest. Tukey's multiple comparison test is also called Tukey's honestly signi{\textregistered}cant difference test or Tukey's HSD. Alternative multiple comparison tests include Sheffe {\^{A}}'s test and Dunnett's test. With only two groups of observations we could compare the two group means using a t-test. When we have more than two groups, it is inappropriate to simply compare each pair using a t-test because of the problem of multiple testing. The correct way to do the analysis is to use a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA ANOVA) to evaluate whether there is any evidence that the means of the populations differ. If the ANOVA ANOVA leads to a conclusion that there is evidence that the group means differ, we might then be interested in investigating which of the means are different. This is where the Tukey multiple comparison test is used. The test compares the difference between each pair of means with appropriate adjustment for the multiple testing. The results are presented as a matrix showing the result for each pair, either as a P-value or as a con{\textregistered}dence interval. The Tukey multiple comparison test, like both the t-test and ANOVA ANOVA, assumes that the data from the different groups come from populations where the observations have a normal distribution and the standard deviation is the same for each group. Many statistical packages offer Tukey multiple comparison test as an option when conducting a one-way ANOVA ANOVA, for example this test is available in SPSS and Minitab. Considering the results in the above paper, we see that the conclusions are not absolutely clear cut. There appear to be two groups of manufacturers with similar means ± A, B, D, E, F and B, C ± but B appears in both groups. This is typical for what can happen with a multiple comparison test.},

Indic. 7, 387-395] presented a combined ranking index to measure the habitats' contribution to regional biodiversity, in which the species-area curves perform poorly in the prediction of the species richness in multiple plots. After re-examination of the dataset (17 vegetation types of the Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA), I present the reason for this poor performance: (1) species-area curve is not identical with species accumulation curve; (2) the latter is steeper than the former due to: (a) rare species normally appearing at coarser spatial scales and (b) beta diversity being positively correlated to the distance between samples. This result implies that Chong and Stohlgren's ranking index is scale dependent. The total number of species in different habitats could serve as an intuitive indicator that is highly correlated with the Chong-Stohlgren index. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Developing a comprehensive system of protected areas accelerated from 2003, but went into reverse since political turmoil erupted in 2009. The tortoise and freshwater turtle fauna of Madagascar comprises 9 species (one with 3 subspecies) in 6 genera; of these, 3 genera, 5 species, and 8 terminal taxa are endemic to the country. All 5 endemic species are rated as Critically Endan- gered in the IUCN Red List, primarily as a result of targeted exploitation for human consumption and international pet trade, as well as habitat loss. Two species of Aldabrachelys tortoises have gone extinct since humans settled Madagascar. Preventing further extinctions of Madagascar's unique tortoises and turtles will require urgent and coordinated conservation action focused on species, ecosystems, and socio-economic development.},

Rarefaction SACs involve pooling multiple samples and then rarifying the pooled sample-making it smaller probabilistically-so that the originally large but rarified sample may be compared with originally small samples. Regression SACs determine if there is a significant statistical relationship between samples of different sizes and the magnitude of the variable of interest per sample.

The present paper is a study of fossil amphibians and squamate reptiles found in 34 Spanish localities, dated from the Upper Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene.This work permits to supplement the knowledge of the settlements of amphibians and squamate reptiles in Spain during the Quaternary and to define the contribution of these faunas to the reconstitution of the landscape and the climate. During the Late Pliocene, several thermophilous groups of squamates will gradually disappear from the Iberian Peninsula following successive climatic pejorations: the Eastern Vipers and the genus Pseudopus, during the MN16, in Cova Bonica (Barcelona), then the Agamidae, at the end of the MN17 in Almenara- Casablanca-1 (Castell{\'{o}}n) and Vallirana (Barcelona). Only the genus Dopasia will persist until the end of the Early Pleistocene (MmQ3) in the South of Spain inBarranco Le{\'{o}}n (Guadix-Baza). At the same time, the observed variations within hygrophilic species suggest a peak of aridity at 2.0 My, and an increase in moisture between 1.3 and 1.0 My in the localities of Barranco Le{\'{o}}n and Fuente Nueva 3 (Guadix-Baza), of Almenara-Casablanca-3 (Castell{\'{o}}n) and especially Cal Guardiola (Barcelona) with the presence in the north of Eurosiberian taxa like thecommon brown frog (Rana temporaria) or the smooth snake (Coronella austriaca) and the withdrawal towards the South of some Mediterranean taxa (Blanus cinereus and Chalcides bedriagai). The stratigraphic sequence of Gran Dolina (Atapuerca, Burgos), thick of 18 m and covering the period going from 1.0 to 0.3 My constitutes a privileged site for the study of climatic and environmental changes. Variations within herpetofauna highlight the alternation of hot-dry periods and colder-wet periods. The evolution of the forest indices within the sequence makes it possible to correlate the fresher phases with a probable more significant development of forest cover. The modern chorologic data of these faunas allow hypothesis for estimating mean annual temperatures and precipitations"},

It has a restricted distribution along the eastern escarpment of South Africa from the Transvaal south to Natal. Kinixys spekii Gray seems to be the next most primitive species, but its depressed carapace is an adaptation that enables it to find refuge in rock crevices. It has a very extensive distribution on the central African plateau. Kinixys belliana Gray is a larger species with a more convex carapace and a black radial pattern on the shields. Its distribution is restricted to the coastal plain. Kinixys lobatsiana Power differs from the other savanna species, and resembles the forest species K. erosa (Schweigger) and K. homeana Bell, in having the posterior marginal shields recurved and serrated.

Mammals first appeared early in the Mesozoic, living alongside dinosaurs for millions of years, but it was not until the extinction of dinosaurs 65 myr ago that the first major explosion of mammalian taxa took place. The Cenozoic (65 Ma to Recent) witnessed repeated and dynamic events involving the radiation, evolution, and extinction of mammalian faunas. Two of these events, each marking the extinction of one diverse fauna and subsequent establishment of another equally diverse fauna, both involving advanced catarrhine primates, are recorded in sites in the Turkana Basin, despite the poorly represented record of Cenozoic faunas elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. The first of these events occurred at the Oligocene-Miocene transition and the other at the Miocene-Pliocene transition.},

One particularly useful set of records are those preserved in lake and marine sediments, recording both climate changes and corresponding biotic responses. Recently there has been increasing focus on the need for conservation of ecological and evolutionary processes in the face of climate change. We review key areas where palaeoecological archives contribute to this conservation goal, namely: (i) determination of rates and nature of biodiversity response to climate change; (ii) climate processes responsible for ecological thresholds; (iii) identification of ecological resilience to climate change; and (iv) management of novel ecosystems. We stress the importance of long-term palaeoecological data in fully understanding contemporary and future biotic responses. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This is our fourth annual compilation of an annotated checklist of all recognized and named taxa of the world's modern chelonian fauna, documenting recent changes and controversies in nomenclature, and including all primary synonyms, updated from our previous three checklists (Turtle Taxonomy Working Group [2007b, 2009], Rhodin et al. [2008]). This year we have expanded the checklist into a comprehensive listing of important aspects of taxonomy, names, distribution, and conservation status of all turtles and tortoises of the world. We strive to record the most recent justified taxonomic assignment of terminal taxa in a hierarchical framework, providing annotations as to whether or not we accept recently proposed changes, and for some taxonomic placements we show alternative arrangements. We provide common English names and detailed distributional data for all taxa, listing occurrence by countries and many smaller political or geo- graphic subunits (states or regions), including indications of native, extirpated, and introduced (modern or prehistoric) populations. We also include current and updated draft IUCN Red List status determinations for all turtles, as well as CITES listings. The diversity of turtles and tortoises in the world that have existed in modern times (since 1500 AD), and currently generally recognized as distinct and included on this checklist, now consists of 328 species. Of these, 56 are polytypic, representing 124 additional recognized subspecies, or 452 total taxa of modern turtles and tortoises. Of these, 8 species and 2 subspecies, or 10 taxa, have gone extinct. As of the current 2010 IUCN Red List, 129 turtle species (62.3{\%} of 207 species listed, 39.3{\%} of all species) are officially regarded as globally Threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable). We now record ad- ditional draft Red List evaluations of the 121 previously “unevaluated” species, and updated draft re-evaluations of 77 previously listed species, allowing us to evaluate the overall current threat levels for all turtles and tortoises. Of the 328 total species of turtles and tortoises, 156 (47.6{\%}) are Threatened, with 90 (27.4{\%}) Critically Endangered or Endangered. If we adjust for predicted threat rates of Data Deficient species, then 54{\%} of all turtles are Threatened. If we include Extinct in the Wild and Extinct species, then 50.3{\%} of all modern turtles and tortoises are either already extinct or threatened with extinction. Turtles are among the most endangered of any of the major groups of vertebrates, more than birds, mammals, cartilaginous fishes, or amphibians.},

abstract = {There is a heated debate about whether all non-native species are 'guilty until proven innocent', or whether some should be accepted or even welcomed. Further fanning the flames, I here present a case where introductions of carefully vetted, non-native species could provide a net conservation benefit. On many islands, native megaherbivores (flightless birds, tortoises) recently went extinct. Here, rewilding with carefully selected non-native species as ecological replacements is increasingly considered a solution, reinstating a herbivory regime that largely benefits the native flora. Based on these efforts, I suggest that restoration practitioners working on islands without a history of native megaherbivores that are threatened by invasive plants should consider introducing a non-native island megaherbivore, and that large and giant tortoises are ideal candidates. Such tortoises would be equally useful on islands where eradication of invasive mammals has led to increased problems with invasive plants, or on islands that never had introduced mammalian herbivores, but where invasive plants are a problem. My proposal may seem radical, but the reversibility of using giant tortoises means that nothing is lost from trying, and that indeed much is to be gained. As an easily regulated adaptive management tool, it represents an innovative, hypothesis-driven 'innocent until proven guilty' approach.},

abstract = {Loss of key plant-animal interactions (e.g., disturbance, seed dispersal, and herbivory) due to extinctions of large herbivores has diminished ecosystem functioning nearly worldwide. Mitigating for the ecological consequences of large herbivore losses through the use of ecological replacements to fill extinct species' niches and thereby replicate missing ecological functions has been proposed. It is unknown how different morphologically and ecologically a replacement can be from the extinct species and still provide similar functions. We studied niche equivalency between 2 phenotypes of Gal{\'{a}}pagos giant tortoises (domed and saddlebacked) that were translocated to Pinta Island in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Archipelago as ecological replacements for the extinct saddlebacked giant tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii). Thirty-nine adult, nonreproductive tortoises were introduced to Pinta Island in May 2010, and we observed tortoise resource use in relation to phenotype during the first year following release. Domed tortoises settled in higher, moister elevations than saddlebacked tortoises, which favored lower elevation arid zones. The areas where the tortoises settled are consistent with the ecological conditions each phenotype occupies in its native range. Saddlebacked tortoises selected areas with high densities of the arboreal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia galapageia) and mostly foraged on the cactus, which likely relied on the extinct saddlebacked Pinta tortoise for seed dispersal. In contrast, domed tortoises did not select areas with cactus and therefore would not provide the same seed-dispersal functions for the cactus as the introduced or the original, now extinct, saddlebacked tortoises. Interchangeability of extant megaherbivores as replacements for extinct forms therefore should be scrutinized given the lack of equivalency we observed in closely related forms of giant tortoises. Our results also demonstrate the value of trial introductions of sterilized individuals to test niche equivalency among candidate analog species.},

Zircon fission-track ages from these sites indicated that hominins had colonized the island by 0.8860.07 million years (Myr) ago6 . Here we describe the contents, context and age of Wolo Sege, a recently discovered archaeological site in the Soa Basin that has in situ stone artefacts and that lies stratigraphically below Mata Menge and immediately above the basement breccias of the basin. We show using 40Ar/39Ar dating that an ignimbrite overlying the artefact layers at Wolo Sege was erupted 1.0260.02Myr ago, pro- viding a new minimum age for hominins on Flores. This predates the disappearance fromthe Soa Basin of ‘pygmy' Stegodon sondaari and Geochelone spp. (giant tortoise), as evident at the nearby site of Tangi Talo, which has been dated to 0.9060.07Myr ago10 .It now seems that this extirpation or possible extinction event and the associated faunal turnover were the result of natural processes rather thanthe arrivalofhominins9 . It alsoappears that thevolcanic and fluvio-lacustrine deposits infilling the SoaBasinmay not be old enough to register the initial arrival of hominins on the island.},

We report here theoretical properties of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimators for these parameters, including their non-uniqueness and inaccuracy, and showthat theoretical expectations indeed apply to real trees. We provide necessary conditions for ML estimators to be well defined and practical implications for model parametrization. 3. We then show how these limitations carry over to difficulties in detecting shifts in selection regimes along a phylogeny.When the phylogenetic placement of these shifts is unknown, we identify a ‘large p -small n'problem where traditionalmodel selection criteria fail and favour overly complex scenarios. Instead, we propose a modi- fied criterion that is better adapted to change-pointmodels. 4. The challenges we identify here are inherent to trait evolutionmodels on phylogenetic treeswhen observations are limited to present-day taxa, and require the addition of fossil taxa to be alleviated.We conclude with recom- mendations for empiricists.},

abstract = {The Late Pliocene locality Ahl al Oughlam (Casablanca, Morocco) yielded a fauna of cryptodiran testudinoid turtles, all of them related to extant African forms. Two terrestrial and one freshwater species are recognized. First, a new small species of the palaearctic genus Testudo Linnaeus, 1758, T. oughlamensis n. sp., is abundantly represented and is closely related to T. kenitrensis Gmira, 1993, from the Middle Pleistocene of Kenitra, Morocco. It is compared to other new remains of Testudo from nearby localities of similar age, including Dehar Mouak and Ar Rehamna. Together with T. kenitrensis, it constitutes a new clade within Testudo, providing a minimum age for the divergence between this clade and T. graeca Linnaeus, 1758 from Morocco. Secondly, the giant ?Centrochelys marocana n. sp., is probably related to the extant C. sulcata (Miller, 1779). Its description gives the opportunity to examine the earliest member of this genus in Morocco, from the nearby Late Miocene/Early Pliocene locality of Lissasfa. Comparisons with Miocene to extant genera of large size from Europe and northern Africa are made. The freshwater species from Ahl al Oughlam is close to the extant species Mauremys leprosa (Schweigger, 1812). It is the earliest record in Morocco of this second palaearctic genus. Thus, the fossil turtle fauna of Casablanca demonstrates the antiquity in Morocco of the three extant genera. Their geographical origin is considered.},

abstract = {Body size is one of the most studied phenotypic attributes because it is biologically important and easily measured. Despite a long history of study, however, the pattern of body-size change in diverse higher taxa over the Phanerozoic remains largely unknown because few relevant data sets span more than a single geological period or provide comprehensive, global coverage. In this study, we measured representative specimens of 3414 brachiopod genera illustrated in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology . We applied these size data to stage-resolved stratigraphic ranges from the Treatise and the Paleobiology Database to develop a Phanerozoic record of trends in brachiopod size. Using a model comparison approach, we find that temporal variation in brachiopod size exhibits two distinct modes—a Paleozoic mode of size increase and a post-Paleozoic mode indistinguishable from a random walk. This transition reflects a change in the identities of the most diverse brachiopod orders rather than a shift in mode within any given order. Paleozoic size increase reflects a small, persistent bias toward the origination of new genera larger than those surviving from the previous stage and is identifiable as a statistically supported trend in three orders representing both Class Strophomenata (Order Productida) and Class Rhynchonellata (orders Atrypida and Spiriferida). Extinction exhibits no consistent bias with respect to size. The shift in evolutionary mode across the end-Permian mass extinction adds to long-standing evidence from studies of diversity and abundance that this biotic catastrophe suddenly and permanently altered the evolutionary history of what was, until that time, the most diverse animal phylum on Earth.},

An emended diagnosis for the second species is provided and additional material of large and small mammals, as well as ectothermic vertebrates, is described. The recorded Lagomorpha show interesting morphological deviations from other Central European material, and probably represent a unique transitional assemblage with a co-occurrence of Titanomys, Lagopsis and Prolagus. Rodentia and Eulipotyphla belong to typical and well-known species of the Agenian of the Swiss Molasse Basin. Abundant small mammal teeth have allowed us to pinpoint the biostratigraphic age of Wallenried to late MN2a. The biostratigraphic age conforms to data derived from the charophyte assemblages and confirms the oldest occurrence of venomous snake fangs. The palaeoenvironmental context is quite complex. Sedimentary structures and fauna (fishes, frogs, salamanders, ostracods) are characteristic for a humid, lacustrine environment within a flood plain system.},

abstract = {The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) has traditionally been viewed as an archetypal desert-adapted vertebrate. However, evidence from historical ecology, phylogenetics, anatomy, physiology, and biogeography qualifies this view significantly. Ancestors of G. agassizii stabilized as an essentially modern morph some 17-19 million yrs ago ago, perhaps 12 million yrs before the formation of major regional deserts in North America. Some physiological mechanisms for avoiding or accommodating desert stressors may be symplesiomorphies, primitive character states common to most ectothermic amniotes. Prominent among these are slow metabolic rates and high tolerances for osmotic flux in body fluids. Other functional characteristics for accommodating contemporary aridity are exaptations shared with forest-dwelling batagurid and manourine chelonian antecedents, originally evolved for terrestrialism, not aridity. Large brittle-shelled eggs, herbivory, and a generalized and expansive digestive tract may all be among these symplesiomorphies, at least relative to the gopherine clade. Other anatomical and behavioral features are associated with a fossorial life style which may have developed in sandy habitats within grasslands and along forest edges, where microclimates were semi-arid, but at a time North American landforms had not yet experienced desert aridity. Burrow excavation may have evolved in response to the stress of intense insolation in exposed scrub, grasslands, and meadows, only later serving as protection against cold, heat, and predators. Modern climate and vegetation typical for contemporary populations of G. agassizii have only developed episodically during perhaps the most recent 1{\%} of its 3–5 million yrs history as a distinct species, and especially during the last 7000 yrs. Biogeographically, neither the testudinids as a group, nor G. agassizii as a species, are confined to deserts. Both track more reliably with warm temperate to tropical climates, and appear to be excluded from the extremely arid zones with less than 50–80 mm mean annual precipitation, such as the lowland deserts of the Baja California Peninsula, Sahara, Atacama, the Choco, and most of the Arabian Peninsula. Both extant and fossil G. agassizii range well beyond the limits of deserts ecologically into thornscrub, woodland, and grassland habitats. Ecologically, Gopherus tortoises generally, and Mojave G. agassizii in particular, exploit a wide variety of food resources. Preponderant components of the diet are succulent, herbaceous vegetation ranging from cactus fruit to a variety of grasses and forbs. Even carrion and insects can constitute a small portion of the diet. Sclerophyllous vegetation, so characteristic of extreme desert habitats, is largely absent from the diet. The desert tortoise functions well in some, but not all, undisturbed desert landscapes. Its survival is contingent upon a combination of ancient exaptations and contemporary adaptations which resist drought and locally dry microclimates and soils, but evolved long before their desert habitats themselves. Semi-arid steppe vegetation, such the mesquite grasslands of the Tamaulipan Plain may combine habitat attributes that are optimal for the G. agassizii (“Xerobates”) species group, as evidenced by the continuing high densities of group member G. berlandieri. Nutritionally, G. agassizii is an opportunistic generalist, shuttling through temporally and spatially patchy forage. As a consequence, G. agassizii appears to be able to accommodate a wide range of environmental changes. Yet when anthropogenic desertification of a pre-existing desert impoverishes the landscape floristically and depletes forage, the opportunities for continued tortoise survival and recruitment may be significantly compromised.},

abstract = {To date, the terrestrial faunal record of the North American late Eocene has been recovered from its subtropical and temperate regions. We report the first late Eocene continental faunal assemblage from tropical North America, in southern Mexico. Fossil specimens were collected from mudstones that crop out in the Municipality of Santiago Yolom??catl, in northwestern Oaxaca. Previously published K-Ar ages of 32.9??0.9 and 35.7??1.0Ma in overlain nearby volcanic rocks and biostratigraphy of these new localities suggests a Chadronian mammal age for this new local fauna. The assemblage is composed by two turtle taxa, Rhineura, two caniform taxa, a sciurid, a jimomyid rodent, a geomyine rodent, Gregorymys, Leptochoerus, Perchoerus probus, Merycoidodon, a protoceratid, Poebrotherium, Nanotragulus, Miohippus assinoboiensis, a chalicotherid, a tapiroid, cf. Amynodontopsis, Trigonias and the hymenopteran ichnofossils Celliforma curvata and Fictovichnus sciuttoi. The records of these taxa in northwestern Oaxaca greatly expand southerly their former geographic distribution in North America. The records of the geomorph rodents and Nanotragulus extend their former known biochronological range to the late Eocene. The hymenopteran ichnofossils in the localities suggest the presence of a bare soil after periodic waterlogging, under a sub-humid to sub-arid climate. This new local fauna represents the first glimpse of Eocene vertebrate and invertebrate terrestrial life from tropical North America.},

abstract = {The Cova del Rinoceront, a site in NE Iberia, contains a thick sedimentary fill preserving a faunal archive from the penultimate glacial and the the last interglacial periods. Layers I to III have been dated to between 74 and 147ka, coinciding with MIS 5a to 5e, a period poorly represented in the Mediterranean terrestrial record. The results from Cova del Rinoceront are of broader interest for the reconstruction of ecological dynamics during warm stages and the understanding of the evolution and geographical variation of several taxa. The palaeoecological evidence suggests a landscape dominated by mixed wooded vegetation with mild climatic conditions, slightly more humid than today. Several vertebrate taxa, including Haploidoceros mediterraneus, Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis and Glis glis, are documented for the first time in the early Upper Pleistocene of Europe, showing that these species persisted across the region for longer than previously thought. In addition, the recovery of a small lithic assemblage indicates human presence in the surroundings of the site. The 11m-thick stratigraphic section also provides an ideal setting in which to compare several geochronological methods. U-Th dating of the flowstones that cap the deposit, of speleothems formed along the cave walls, and of speleothems buried by the deposit at different elevations provides minimum and maximum ages of 74 and 175ka, respectively, for the accumulation. The ages obtained by luminescence, electron spin resonance (ESR), amino acid racemisation (AAR), palaeomagnetism and U-series dating of bone are in good agreement with each other and are stratigraphically consistent. This well-dated faunal succession presents a unique opportunity to assess changes in the Pleistocene fauna of the Mediterranean coast over an interval of more than 100ka.},

abstract = {Proficiency in mathematics and statistics is essential to modern ecological science, yet few studies have assessed the level of quantitative training received by ecologists. To do so, we conducted an online survey. The 937 respondents were mostly early-career scientists that studied biology as undergraduates. We found a clear self-perceived lack of quantitative training: 75{\%} are not satisfied with their understanding of mathematical models; 75{\%} feel the level of mathematics was “too low” in their ecology classes; 90{\%} wanted more mathematics classes for ecologists; and 95{\%} more statistics classes. Respondents thought that 30{\%} of classes in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative disciplines; likely more than what is taught in most universities. The main suggestion to improve quantitative training was to relate theoretical and statistical modeling to applied ecological problems. Improving quantitative training will require more mathematics classes for ecology-related degrees, and also more ecology classes containing mathematical and statistical examples.},

The data matrix consists of 136 osteological parsimony informative characters with 169 derived character states for 45 fossil and 22 living species of the clade Testudinata. The results corroborate the monophyly of a large number of previously hypothesized clades, but refute the accepted hypothesis regarding the basal split of living turtles. In particular, the primitive turtles Proterochersis robusta, Kayentachelys aprix, Mongolochelys efremovi, Meiolania platyceps, and Kallokibotion bajazidi are removed from their current position as crown turtles and placed along the phylogenetic stem of this clade. The age of the turtle crown is thereby adjusted from the Late Triassic to the Late Jurassic, which is relevant to testing molecular clock hypotheses. This revised topology has...},

abstract = {The Famara massif, in the north of Lanzarote Island, constitutes the remains of a former island inhabited by the oldest known vertebrate fauna of the Canary archipelago off the coast of Africa. In this study, new ages are offered for the underlying and overlying basaltic lava flows of two paleontological sites. The island's three major palaeontological sites, which contain remains of this ancient fauna (Valle Grande, Valle Chico and Fuente de Gusa), are intercorrelated according to their lithologies, sedimentology, palaeontological content and geochronology. The new K/Ar age interval for the fossiliferous sedimentary deposits ranges between 4.3??????0.7 and 3.78??????0.71 Ma, within the Early Pliocene, and shows that the first known terrestrial animals in Lanzarote were present on the island for about 500 ka. The principal component of the deposits is a bioclastic calcarenite of aeolian origin (sand sheet deposits), which is present in all three sites and constitutes 65{\%} of the beds. The remaining 35{\%} is of fluvial-aeolian origin (mainly stream deposits). All the beds contain the same fossils (insect egg pods, land snails, avian eggshells and tortoise eggshells). The local palaeogeography and the formation of the deposits were conditioned by a flat plain, larger than 16??km2, over which aeolian sands moved freely with a prevailing NNE-WSW wind direction. In agreement with previous investigations, the palaeoclimate in this interval (ca. 4.3 to 3.8 Ma) must have been mainly dry with some rainy episodes.},
