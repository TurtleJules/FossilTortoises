\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Completeness of data set}

completeness of data set/benefits of additional sampling (SACs)
- how much of the "actual" data is represented by our data set?




\subsection{Population structure?}


\subsection{Time-scale analysis}

--> what does model support depend on? what does a relatively low model support mean?


% LIMITATIONS
%\todo{add at some point that phylogenetics were not considered because not enough data for fossil species --> or only in discussion? full-evidence analysis would be nice as in Slater et al., 2017 (baleen whales) --> cite Lapparent de Broin, 2006 + 2001: phylogenetic relationships between genera are not definitely established, }
