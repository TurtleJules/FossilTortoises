\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Data coverage}
The sample-based accumulation curve shows that the body size data set covers the generic level well, but not the species level.
Since there are less genera than species, it is to be expected that genera reach an asymptote earlier than species \citep{Gotelli2001}.
Although the accumulation curve for the entire data set does not completely plateau, considering the large area covered \citep{Thompson2002} and the high number of rare genera in the dataset, it can be considered well enough sampled for the present study \citep{Gotelli2001}.
Conducting the rest of the analyses on the generic level is advantage ous here, because many fossils cannot be identified at the species level and species that are rare in the fossil record may not reflect their actual abundance, since only a small number of individuals are actually preserved \citep{Jass2014}.
According to \cite{Rhodin2015} 121 species of testudinidae have been recognized in the fossil record since the beginning of the Pleistocene. For 117 species from that time period, body size data could be obtained for this study, therefore it can be assumed, that the data set sufficiently resembles the actual fossil record of testudinidae on a global scale.
For smaller-scale analyses, for example, on individual continents, further body size data should be collected.
%For insular species, the oldest fossils with body size data available stem from the Upper Miocene, which matches the colonization of islands by tortoises ? \citep{.}

% DISCUSSION: as could be expected, since there are less genera than species \citep{Gotelli2001}. At a large geographic scale, it can be expected, that an asymptote is not reached \citep{Thompson2002}. Fig. \ref{fig:SACGen} corresponds to the shape one would expect, when there are many genera that are rare and only a few abundant ones. For the different continents, only Europe and Eurasia show some sort of "typical" SAC shape.

\subsection{Distribution of testudinid body size}

Distribution of testudinid body size is rather uniform across a spatial and temporal scale.
The body size distribution is right-skewed on a large scale, as well as for modern, fossil and continental species, which has been reported frequently for animal body size distributions \citep{Blackburn1994,Kozlowski2002}.
Only insular taxa show a body size distribution that is skewed to the left, with a higher frequency of larger-bodied species. This left-skewed distribution is largely driven by fossil insular species, as modern insular species are not skewed and show a rather flat, symmetrical distribution.
The bimodality of the overall body size distribution and the consistency across the continents is similar to what \cite{Lyons2008} report for Quaternary mammals. However, since tortoise body size is only sampled well enough for Europe and Eurasia, these results have to be considered with caution.
When looking at continental tortoises on a temporal scale, the second mode of large body sizes disappears for modern tortoises, which is probably due to the extinction of large continental taxa, similar to what has been observed in the mammalian megafauna during the Quaternary \citep{Lyons2008}. For insular species the bimodal body size distribution is constant over time, which could be expected, since large insular forms are still present, in spite of their diminished diversity and abundance compared to former times \citep{Rhodin2015}.
Whether or not these results can be considered as complying the island rule, depends on the biogeographic history of giant tortoises and whether they evolved to be large on islands or prior to island colonizations. Many authors agree that tortoises were already large when they colonized the islands \citep{Itescu2014,Cheke2016, Gerlach2006,Caccone1999}, which would contradict the island rule, as has also been argued in a large-scale study on the intra-specific, inter-specific as well as on the clade level \citep{Itescu2014}. 
%Cheke et al 2016. co-evolution with plants they feed on --> are exactly thee same height
Modern tortoises are smaller-bodied than their fossil conspecifics, which coincides with earlier findings for animals in general \citep{Blackburn1994} and reptiles as a clade \citep{Smith2016}.




%Lyons 2008:
%Here we are using a macroecological approach to examine patterns in mammalian body size distributions at multiple spatial and temporal scales
%and as a result, mam- malian body size distributions have been well studied and found to be re- markably consistent across continents (Smith et al. 2004) and across re- cent time (Lyons et al. 2004).
%The overall shapes and ranges of the body size distribu- tions are similar on each of the four main continents, Eurasia, Africa, North America, and South America (fi

%(discuss Jaffe et al., Itescu et al., Millien et al.??)

%As has been reported for many animals, the body size distribution of testudinidae is right-skewed. 
%The bimodal distribution looks similar to those of mammals reported by \cite{Lyons2008}. Values for skewness and kurtosis are also similar \todo{check again!!} (in this context it has to be noted, that \cite{Lyons2008} reported excess kurtosis, which is kurtosis - 3).
%Other than for the mammalian communities these authors investigated, the second mode of larger body size is still apparent in testudinidae, because giant tortoises did not go extinct completely, although their abundance has decreased considerably.

\subsection{Time-scale analysis}

The time scale analysis showed that overall there is no change in testudinid body size. However, if only considering continental taxa, unbiased random walk is the favoured model, which is a special case of directional evolution, where the probability of descendants being larger or smaller than their ancestors is the same.
This change is most likely due to the extinction of the giant continental forms, which is also apparent in the frequency curves. 
%There is a large drop in mean body size at the Gelasian/Lower Pleistocene border. --> Results!
For insular species, however, stasis is again the favoured evolutionary model, which seems plausible since there still are giant forms on islands today. Also, model support is the highest for insular species, fitting only stasis.
On a continental level, for Europe stasis fits best for the complete data set as well as for continental and insular species.
Eurasia, however, reflects the overall trend, with body size of continental genera being best described by a unbiased random walk, although model support is weaker than for Europe.
Yet, all model supports for Eurasia (complete, continental and insular) are better than for the overall data set and the continetal taxa, which suggest that Eurasia somehow drives this trend.
It would be interesting to see which model fits best, if more Asian samples were being included.

In the literature, stasis is often encountered in large-scale analysis \citep{Smith2016, Hunt2006,Hunt2007,Hunt2015}. On a broad scale, stasis may be favoured when evolutionary changes are too small to be noted \citep{Hunt2015}.
Unbiased random walk has also been reported for several animal groups at the clade leven \citep{Smith2016}.
The unbiased random walk for continental testudinids is certainly influenced by the complete loss of giant forms in recent times. Additionaly, tendencies towards smaller body size has been suggested for certain tortoise species \citep{Klein2000,Steele2005,Franz2005,Speth2002}.
That stasis is the favoured model for insular taxa as well as insular and continental taxa combined, although modern tortoises have significantly smaller body sizes compared to fossil tortoises, might be because the range of body sizes is still considerably large for insular taxa, whereas the range of body sizes in extant continental taxa is profoundly smaller than for fossil continental taxa.
Therefore, the within-lineage tendencies towards smaller body size might not be visible as a trend at the clade level as long as body size range does not decrease significantly.

%what does unbiased random walk tell me about possible reasons? selection pressure? or not because it is not driven in one direction?
\subsection{Causes for extinction}
There are numerous accounts of tortoise exploitation by humans from all over the world \citep{Blasco2008,Blasco2011,Blasco2016,Pritchard2013,Speth2002,Thompson2014,Steadman2017,Franz2001,Avery2004,Karl2012,Archer2014,Mudar2007,Munro2010,Peres2006,Sampson1998,Sampson2000} and extinction patterns in tortoises are associated with the spread of hominin and humans, for example that they reached islands later, which is why many large island species were overexploited leading to their extinction during the Holocene \citep{Rhodin2015}. 
In many archeological sites where tortoise remains are found, cut or burn marks are visible, indicating human consumption \citep{.}. But besides direct anthropogenic threats like hunting, human presence was associated with issues like habitat fragmentation or, especially on islands, introduced predators or competitors which may have further accelerated tortoise extinction \citep{.}. 
Tortoises are frequently found associated with proboscideans \citep{Hooijer1951,Vlachos2014}, which were found to have been overexploited by humans and only able to survive in regions inaccessible to humans \citep{Surovell2005}.
The significant decrease in tortoise body size that was observed in this study also coincides with the time of human spread and may be comparable to the exploitation of the mammalian megfauna, for which human influence has been suggested to be the main cause \citep{Barnosky2004, Sandom2014}.
Further, for the other group of terrestrial tortoises, the Australian Meiolaniidae, evidence suggests that human exploitation lead to their extinction \citep{White2010}.
However, there are also records of mass mortalities of giant insular tortoises in Mauritius and Réunion, before humans had reached the islands \citep{Cheke2016}. Moreover, there are still extant species that have been heavily exploited, which did not lead to their extinction but instead to a decrease in body size \citep{Stiner1999,Steele2005}.
Still, the literature suggests that human overexploitation is likely to have caused many tortoise extinction, possibly in conjunction with climate change \citep{Cione2003}.


%DISCUSS human exploitation (Froyd 2014) Holman1984 Moodie1979 Hansen2010
%human extirpation --> direct: hunting, indirect: habitat fragmentation (especially on continents maybe? since on islands range is smaller anyway), introduced predators (island forms had thinner shells! what about continental ones... probably too since they grew large and needed to reduce weight --> armoured animals)\\
%reasons for extinction:
%--> Aldabra/Galapagos (whaling industry)
%--> mammal megafauna was hunted to extinction by humans
%--> Meiolania were extirpated by humans!! \citep{White2010}

Giant tortoises seem to occupy only a small temperature range, since they are in danger of overheating \citep{.}, but also seem to be unable to cope with cold winters \citep{Hibbard1960}. However, since they are currently still present on some islands, climatic conditions seem to be suitable. Climate change might have indirectly influenced tortoise populations through altered vegetation cover, which serves as a source of shade and food for tortoises \citep{Hunter2013, Cheke2016, Schleich1981}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The results suggest that the extinction of giant continental fossils accounts for differences in evolutionary patterns of continental and insular species. Loss of biodiversity is not reflected in these patterns, if the size range does not change significantly.
The significant size difference between modern and fossil tortoises on a global scale and within-lineage tendencies are also not reflected as a trend in body size.
Possible reasons for the extinction of giant tortoises are complex and require further investigation. On the one hand, direct and indirect anthropogenic influence is massive and may have affected tortoises in the same way as it affected the mammalian megafauna \citep{Barnosky2004,Sandom2014}. On the other hand, giant tortoises seem to be sensitive to their environment in terms of thermoregulation and climatic fluctuations might have affected tortoise populations \citep{.}.
%while at the same time being ecosystem engineers
%include conservation efforts somehow!
%- reasons for extinction complex! on the one hand anthropogenic influence massive (and has been identified as main reason for mammalian megafauna), on the other hand, especially giant tortoises very specialized and sensitive to environmental change (thermoregulation, vegetation cover, burrowing ability, distribution range/inter-specific competition, diet, predation risks --> decreased armour/thin shells, especially in giant forms due to decreased weight, migration), but on the other hand might be ecosystem engineers?! (--> introduced species, Froyd 2014)


This study would certainly benefit from further sampling, ideally by directly measuring fossil specimens from museum collections.
With a larger data set, smaller-scale analyses could be conducted, for example for separate continents or individual lineages.
It would also be interesting to include phylogenetic relationships, although many species and genera would have to be revisited and revised before a complete phylogeny can be created.

%I would assume, that climate drove some decrease in body size (as exemplified by \textit{Gopherus agassizi} \citep{.} and \textit{Chersina angulata}), although in the last example the size decrease has been labeled human-induced (since large individuals are hunted more frequently, shifting the body size distribution to the smaller scale).

%As drawn, there is no upward tendency, as increases and decreases in size are equally frequent. This is the pattern expected in the null case with no evolutionary forces acting at the scale of the lineage. Notice, however, that there is nevertheless a trend—a trend in the maximum. The distinction is that “tendency” refers to the pattern of change at the lower level, in this case the species level, whereas “trend” refers to a change in a summary statistic at the clade level, in this case an increase in the clademaximum.Other summary statistics of interest include the mean, median, and minimum. Thus, there is not necessarily a connection between tendency and trend: One can have a trend without a tendency. For body size evolution in particular, the most commonly observed and documentable kind of trend—a rise in the maximum—does not by itself tell us much about underlying tendencies. Maxima are expected to increase even if no tendencies, no evolutionary forces, are present. Thus, we cannot infer the existence of a selective advantage of large size merely from an increase in the maximum. The
