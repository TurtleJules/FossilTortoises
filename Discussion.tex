\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Completeness of data set}

completeness of data set/benefits of additional sampling (SACs)
- how much of the "actual" data is represented by our data set?




\subsection{Population structure?}


\subsection{Time-scale analysis}

--> what does model support depend on? what does a relatively low model support mean?


% LIMITATIONS
%\todo{add at some point that phylogenetics were not considered because not enough data for fossil species --> or only in discussion? full-evidence analysis would be nice as in Slater et al., 2017 (baleen whales) --> cite Lapparent de Broin, 2006 + 2001: phylogenetic relationships between genera are not definitely established, }


- study would benefit from more sampling! (SAC, model supports paleoTS)

- include more data, not only literature but actually measure shells/other skeletal elements --> maybe gather further data to more reliably estimate body sizes

- include shapes/geometric morphometrics --> volume/body mass?

- paleoTS --> is designed to deal with incomplete data (FOSSIL)

- unbiased random walk on continents --> CL fluctuates more than on islands --> "giant" forms completetely disappeared in comparison to insular species

- what can influence distribution: climate, selective pressures, diet, intra-specific competition (Madagascar)

- I guess: climate affects body size reduction, but extinctions were human-driven
--> Aldabra/Galapagos (whaling industry)
--> mammal megafauna was hunted to extinction by humans

Aldabra tortoise: no evidence of size increase, probably originate from giant continental tortoises (large tortoises are able to float: bouyancy and fasting endurance)

\subsection{Conclusion}


This study would definitely benefit from further sampling, beyond literature research but actual measurements of museum collections, especially on the continents other than Europe. Possibly, a nearly complete (as complete as it can be, based on fossils) dataset could be achieved, if estimates based on single scutes/shell fragments could be established.

Giant tortoises seem to occupy only a small temperature range, since they are in danger of overheating (...), but also cannot cope with cold winters (...). However, obviously appropriate climates are still available, since giant tortoises are still present in some places, which means climate alone cannot have driven the extinction, at least not on tropical islands.
I would assume, that climate drove some decrease in body size (as exemplified by Gopherus agassizi (...) and Cherins angulata), although in the last example the size decrease has been labeled human-induced (since large individuals are hunted more frequently, shifting the body size distribution to the smaller scale).
