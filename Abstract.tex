\section{Abstract}


- no body size trend in global scale
- continents: random walk
- islands: stasis

- modern testudinids are smaller than fossil ones
- continental testudinids are smaller than insular ones
--> these proportions are constant over time

- population strucure is constant on spatial and temporal scale
- right-skewed like most animals; bimodal; on islands: left-skewed (more large species!)
