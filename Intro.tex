\section{Introduction}

Body size has been of interest to researchers for a long time (Haldane, ..., Peters, ...), because it is a universal trait, that can be easily measured in most organisms. Moreover, it is linked to and influenced by many ecological and evolutionary processes, although the underlying mechanisms are often complex. 
Some basic questions deal with the issue of optimal body size: is there one for every organism and if so, how is it determined, how does it evolve?
Animals --> magintudes of body size, many have their greatest body size right now, possible maximum has not been reached! BUT reptiles not

--> optimal body size

--> evolutionary models???

--> maximum body size 

--> megafauna 

--> human-induced extinction / climate

--> reptile "megafauna" --> large turtles (archelon) --> giant tortoises!

--> have been abundant on continents and islands in former times. no longer, only on islands.
in earlier publication fossil testudinids were grouped into two genera, based on size: small = testudo, large = geochelone. 
By now, most areas have been revised: America = Hesperotestudo and Chelonoidis (Galapagos), Europe = Cheirogaster or better: Titanochelon, Africa = Aldabrachelys, Chersina, Asia = Geochelone ??

Evolution of tortoises:
- where did they originate, how did they spread?
--> floated to islands
--> relationship with humans --> tortoises/turtles as food - whaling industry
- tortoise extinctions --> only on Galapagos and Aldabra giant tortoises --> which went extinct within the last couple of years? --> which are associated with humans?
what about climate?
--> largest extant continental tortoise: Centrochelys sulcata (80 cm)





%________________________________________________________________________________

- Body size as a trait (read Smith, Smith \& Lyons) and over time
why is it interesting?
is there an optimal body size for every organism? how can it be determined? (--> stasis??)

- evolutionary models (read Gene Hunt's paper and Posada, 2003)
-->  make sense of evolutionary modes:
* stasis
* unbiased random walk
* generalized random walk


- body size in tortoises %(why not use biomass? - not necessary)
- distribution of tortoises (?)
- giant tortoises well suited for drifting on ocean currents (Meylan, 2000)

OR
- mammal megafauna extinctions --> giant tortoises

- human and climatic influence

- purpose of this work: determine body size trends in tortoises and identify evolutionary mode (if possible). what lead to extinction?
