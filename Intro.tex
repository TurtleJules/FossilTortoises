\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Body size evolution}

%Laurin, 2004
The body size of organisms has been of interest to researchers for a long time \citep{Haldane1928,Peters1983}. It is a universal trait that can easily be measured and compared among different organisms \citep{Smith2016}. Furthermore, it is readily available for many animals in the fossil record which allows for comparison with extant species. In general, a number of biotic and abiotic factors including habitat, resource availability, competition, climate and many more influence body size which is also linked to ecological and evolutionary processes \citep{Blackburn1994a,Blueweiss1978,Smith2009}.
Specifically, body size is dependent on resource availability, intra- and interspecific competition and environmental conditions during development, genetic predisposition, and a trade-off between costs of early vs. late maturation, namely investing in growth or reproduction \citep{Stearns2000}. Extreme habitats or environmental conditions can result in extreme body size changes, i. e. in dwarfism, either due to restricted resources or reduced predation, or gigantism, which is usually linked to reduced competition. Finally, extreme body size is constrained by physical, physiological and structural properties, e. g. newborns of marine mammals like whales need to weigh at least 5\,kg to maintain their body temperate due to the high rate of convective heat loss in the water \citep{Downhower1988,Smith2016}.
Different body sizes are associated with different requirements. On the one hand, larger animals need more resources, therefore usually occupy a larger territory and have longer generation times than smaller ones, which is associated with a lower population density. On the other hand, they are also less prone to predation, live longer and have increased competitive abilities \citep{Stearns2000, Smith2016}. 

%--> body size can be taphonomically biased in the fossil record

%, for example \todo{example?!}.
Patterns of body size variation across spatial and/or temporal scales have been described for many animal groups and some have been summarised as ecological rules \citep{Millien2006,Angielczyk2015}.
%and many biogeographical rules concern body size evolution: 
For example, Cope's rule describes the gradual within-lineage body size increase over time \citep{Cope1887}. According to the island rule large species become smaller on islands, because of a reduced predation risk, while small species often show an increase in body size due to reduced competition \citep{Foster1964}. Bergmann's rule states that animals attain a larger body size at higher latitudes \citep{Bergmann1848}, which can be considered a special case of the temperature-size rule, which predicts an increase in body size at lower temperatures \citep{AngillettaJr2004a}.
While such patterns have been well documented
%described in many animal groups and species 
\citep{Millien2006}, the underlying mechanisms might not be the same across all taxa and require further investigation \citep{Smith2009}.


%Smith et al., 2016
%However, when patterns of size increase are examined within lower-level taxa (e.g., phyla, classes), the trends found there are generally more consistent with the null (Table 2)

\subsection{Maximum body size - Megafauna}
In many taxa a right-skewed body size distribution is observed, which means that smaller body sizes are more abundant than large ones \citep{Blackburn1994a,Kozlowski2002,Lyons2008}. 
Evolutionary theory implies that this skewed distribution is the optimal distribution of body sizes, taking into account all external constraints \citep{Smith2009}. But what factors determine its shape?
%This raises the question as to why organisms reach a certain size, if there is an optimal body size for each organisms, why some species attain larger sizes than others and which structural, physical and physiological properties determine and limit minimum or maximum body size
%the maximum possible body size depends on, structurally, physically and physiologically 
%are distribution yA potential optimal body size and extreme body size - either large or small - are of particular interest to many researchers . 
As stated above, a large body size is associated with certain advantages and disadvantages \citep{Smith2016}.
%, e. g. decreased predation risk, higher fasting endurance and higher competitive ability, all of which contribute to a higher fitness \citep{.}.
%On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to having a larger body size since usually a larger range size and more resources are needed and generation times are often longer \citep{.}.
%a lot of implications regarding resource availability, resilience, fecundity, 
%but it has also been debated whether larger body sizes may entail a higher risk of extinction (...).
In the history of Earth, animals have repeatedly attained very large body sizes, although patterns of when and how often maximum body size is achieved are inconsistent across time and different animal groups \citep{Smith2016}.
%(Also, different patterns in minimum size, which could be due to poorer preservation of smaller forms.)
Some famous examples of giant forms are the large insects from the Carboniferous/Permian period, the giant non-avian dinosaurs from the Jurassic/Triassic, the giant mammals from the Quatenary or today's largest animal, the blue whale \citep{Smith2016}.
%Giant animal forms are often intrigiung, because they usually present the upper limit of what is possibe physically, physiologically and structurally. 
%For example, the large insect (dragonflies etc.) from the Carbonian/Permian border (?) seem absolutely surreal to us as well as the later non-avian dinosaurs, which still fascinate many people. And today's largest animal, the blue whale, is of interest to many people.
Animals with a body mass exceeding 44 kg are referred to as megafauna \citep{Barnosky2004, Rhodin2015, Sandom2014,Koch2006}.
%Animals are considered megafauna, if their body mass/body length exceeds 44 kg \citep{Barnosky2004} .
%Large size can have many advantages but also some disadvantages.
%Especially the mammalian megafauna has been in the focus of research, wooly mammoths, giant sloths, waldelefanten?, etc.
It has been suggested that large animals are more prone to extinction than smaller ones, because their longer generation times and descreased population densities make them vulnerable in case of a diminished population size \citep{Koch2006}. 
During the Quaternary, a huge number of large mammals which were considered megafauna went extinct \citep{Lyons2008,Smith2016,Koch2006}.
Two possible reasons for this extinction event have been discussed:
climate change and anthropogenic influence \citep{Koch2006}.
Some recent studies suggest that human influence has been the main driver of extinctions of mammalian megafauna \citep{Barnosky2004,Sandom2014,Gibbons2004,Schuster2000}.

%- extinctions seem to be more size-biased in vertebrates

While the mammalian megafauna as well as their extinction %Pleistocene extinctions 
have been well investigated, the herpetofauna has also lost a considerable number of species during the Quaternary \citep{Blain2016}. 
For example, many turtle and tortoise species have gone extinct, with several large species among them, which can also be considered megafauna \citep{Rhodin2015,Froyd2014,Pedrono2013}.
One popular example of a giant tortoise is \textit{Megalochelys atlas}, which frequently reaches carapace lengths of over 2 m and occured throughout Asia, on the mainland and on several islands \citep{Arnold1979}. Similarly sized tortoises have also been found in southern Greece \citep{Bachmayer1979}
In fact, giant tortoises were abundant on the continents as well as on many islands throughout the Neogene \citep{DeLapparentdeBroin2002}. In contrast, nowadays giant tortoises are present only on two island regions in the tropics, the Galapagos Islands, which are located off the western coast of Ecuador, and the West Indian Islands, which consist of Madagascar and its surrounding islands \citep{Baur1889,Braithwaite2016}
% - the Galapagos islands and the West Indian islands



%Some basic questions deal with the issue of optimal body size: is there one for every organism and if so, how is it determined, how does it evolve?
%Animals --> magintudes of body size, many have their greatest body size right now, possible maximum has not been reached! BUT reptiles not


% Smith et al., 2016:
%For body size evolution in particular, the most commonly observed and documentable kind of trend—a rise in the maximum—does not by itself tell us much about underlying tendencies. Maxima are expected to increase even if no tendencies, no evolutionary forces, are present. Thus, we cannot infer the existence of a selective advantage of large size merely from an increase in the maximum.
%If a clade first evolves at a size close to the minimum size possible for a particular body plan or ecology and subsequent speciation events are random with respect to size (i.e., descendants are equally likely to be larger or smaller than their ancestors), thenmean size will increase, because the lower bound prevents the variance from increasing in the direction of smaller sizes. This is an example of a passive trend, one with no increasing tendency.
%A positive association between body size and extinction risk has been demonstrated for Pleistocene and living mammals (Lyons et al. 2004, Davidson et al. 2009), marine and fresh- water fishes (Olden et al. 2007), and birds (Boyer 2010). The association between body size and extinction risk is widely interpreted to result from the inverse association of body size with ecologically important traits such as population size, fecundity, and total resource requirements (Brown 1995).

\subsection{Giant Tortoises - \T}
%\todo{Smith2009 mammalian megafauna analyzed by kurtosis and skewness, followed, applicable to giant tortoises --> similar results or not?}

In the fossil record two clades of terrestrial tortoises have been identified, which both contained giant forms. One is the family Meiolaniidae, which occurred exclusively in Argentina, Australia and its surrounding islands and is completely extinct nowadays \citep{Sterli2015, Hay1908}. The other one is the family Testudinidae, which comprises all extant terrestrial tortoises as well as many extinct or fossil taxa \citep{Auffenberg1974,VanDijk2014}. The testudinids included giant forms and occurred on all continents but Australia \citep{Fritz2007}.
Testudinidae have been known in the fossil record from the Eocene onwards, the earliest fossils being \textit{Hadrianus} which are known from North America and Europe and probably originated in Asia \citep{Cope1871}.
Body size played an important role in the earlier times of testudinid taxonomy \citep{DeLapparentdeBroin2001,DeLapparentdeBroin2000}. In the beginning, all tortoise fossils were assigned to the genus Testudo, but around the 20th century tortoises were grouped into two clades based on body size \citep{DeLapparentdeBroin2006}. Large taxa were all assigned to the genus \textit{Geochelone}, while small tortoises were assigned to \textit{Testudo} \citep{DeLapparentdeBroin2001,DeLapparentdeBroin2000}.
Eventually, over the past few decades, the taxonomy has been revised for many clades \citep{DeLapparentdeBroin2000}. In the Americas, all tortoises are now referred to as either \textit{Hesperotestudo}, \textit{Gopherus} or \textit{Chelonoidis}, with the latter containing all extant Galapagos giant tortoises \citep{Fritts1984}. In Europe, the genus \textit{Cheirogaster} has been introduced but is currently being replaced by \textit{Titanochelon}, although not all species have been revised accordingly yet \citep{Perez-Garcia2014}. Small species still belong to \textit{Testudo}, which contains the extant species \textit{T. graeca}, \textit{T. hermanni}, \textit{T. marginata}, \textit{T. kleinmanni} and \textit{T. horsfieldii} \citep{Fritz2007}.
In Asia and Africa, which are the two current biodiversity hotspots for turtles and tortoises in general , many different taxa have now been differentiated \citep{Holroyd2003}.
In Asia, the genera \textit{Geochelone}, \textit{Indotestudo} and \textit{Manouria} are present \citep{Claude2011,Tong2006}. On mainland Africa there are seven extant genera: \textit{Homopus}, \textit{Psammobates}, \textit{Kinixys}, \textit{Malacochersus}, \textit{Chersina}, \textit{Stigmochelys} and \textit{Centrochelys}, the latter consisting of only one species, \textit{Centrochelys sulcata}, which is the largest extant continental tortoise with a carapace length of about 80 cm \citep{Hansen2010}. In the West Indian Islands (Madagascar, Seychelles, Aldabra etc.), there are three extant gerena, \textit{Astrochelys}, \textit{Pyxis} and the giant \textit{Aldabrachelys}, as well as the extinct \textit{Cylindraspis} \citep{Austin2003,Austin2001}.

Both on the contintents and on remote islands giant tortoises exceeding carapace lengths of 2 m were abundant in former times and have frequently been found in fossil deposits \citep{Rhodin2015,Pritchard2013}. The presence of large tortoises on islands has been explained by their ability to float and to survive for months without water or food \citep{Gerlach2006, Patterson1973, Cheke2016}. 
%Cheke et al. 2016: Meilania also floated to islands!!
%The colonization of islands has been achieved by tortoises due to their resilience, they can cope without food or water for months (which is why they have been exploited by humans in the past --> whaling industry), their bouyancy. 
However, the abundance of giant tortoises on these remote oceanic islands along with their resilience and survivability without resources made them a very attractive food item for humans, especially in the whaling industry \citep{Townsend1925}. 
In addition to the exploitation of giant tortoises on islands, both small and large tortoises and turtles were also frequently eaten on the mainland \citep{Thompson2014}.
%But also on the mainlands, and also small species have frequently been eaten, since turtles and tortoises 
Tortoises are easily captured, do not need a great amount of preparation before they can be cooked and can even be kept as a "staple" since they stay alive for quite a while withoud food or water \citep{Thompson2002,Thompson2014}. Intensive hunting and exploitation has been suggested to affect tortoise body size \citep{Speth2002}; since larger individuals are more easily visible and yield more meat, they are more prone to exploitation than small ones \citep{Rhodin2015}. This may have lead to a decreased body size within a tortoise population where tortoise consumption is common.
For this reason, tortoise body size has even been suggested as a proxy for human population size in some areas \citep{Steele2005,Stiner1999}.
To this day, turtles and tortoises are still being eaten in some countries, although many are endangered \citep{Rhodin2015}.

Apart from anthropogenic influences, climate probably also affected tortoises \citep{VanderSluis2014}. 
As ectotherms, turtles and tortoises are inherently more dependent on climate than endotherms \citep{Delfino2003}. Especially large tortoises are very temperature-sensitive due to their unique physiology and morphology \citep{Swingland1979a, Swingland1979}. In the fossil record, large tortoises are considered to be an indicator for warm periods characterized by mild winters \citep{Hibbard1960,Schleich1981}, since they are thought to not have been able to dig themselves burrows for hibernation like modern \textit{Gopherus} tortoises do %(?? only in some places, I guess?)
\citep{Carlson1999, Stoyanov2009}. Additionally, giant tortoises run a high risk of overheating and display behavioral thermoregulation to keep their body temperature below a dangerous or even lethal value \citep{Sturbaum1982, Schleich1981}.
%It has not been concluded with certainty, if anthropogenic influence or climate change or a mixture of both have caused the extinction of giant tortoises \citep{Rhodin2015}.
Many extant tortoise species are endangered and extinction rates have been especially high for insular species since the Pleistocene \citep{Rhodin2015}.
In fact, a number of giant insular tortoise species went extinct relatively recently within just few centuries \citep{Rhodin2015}.
%PROBLEMSTELLUNG???
Understanding how giant form of tortoises evolved and how their size relates to their extinction, can hold valuable information about basic evolutionary processes and can even find application in current conservation efforts \citep{Hansen2010}.



% \todo{over which time period??}

\subsection{Aim of this work}

\T have an excellent fossil record due to their rigid shell, which is easily preserved and provides information on body size \citep{Lujan2014}. Conversely, other skeletal structures like limbs and especially skulls are rarer in the fossil record \citep{Lujan2014}.
%Since skulls are often used to resolve phylogenetic relationships, this makes it difficult to establish a phylogeny that comprises all testudinids, fossil and extant.
For this reason, it is difficult to resolve phylogenetic relationships of fossil tortoises, since phylogenetic inferences are often are often drawn from skull features \citep{Lujan2014,DeLapparentdeBroin2000,DeLapparentdeBroin2001}. However, since \T are monophyletic, comparisons can be studied on the clade level.

%body size can be easily measured from preserved shells and allow for studies on clade level,  \citep{.}.
In this study, I am interested in several aspects of testudinid body size.
First, how  body size data is distributed within \T in general. For the description and exploration of body size distributions, I follow the methods described in \cite{Lyons2008}.
Secondly, since many large-bodied species have gone extinct, I would expect extant tortoises to be smaller than fossil ones. Thirdly, as extant tortoises reach larger body sizes on islands than on the mainland, if this pattern can be observed in fossil testudinids as well.
Finally, the main goal of this study is to identify general body size trends in tortoises (Testudinidae) on a global scale across the last 20 million years. 

%Further, I aimed to investigate body size distributions of testudinids globally, as well as on continents and islands separately.
Giant tortoises, that only occur on islands nowadays, used to be abundant on continents until many species went extinct several hundreds of years ago \citep{Rhodin2015,Pritchard2013}. 
Therefore, I would expect body size to decrease over time and this change to be reflected in the evolutionary trajectory. 
To test this, the methods of \cite{Hunt2006,Hunt2008} and \cite{Hunt2010} are used. The mean of a trait, in this case carapace length, over time is fitted to different evolutionary models - either stasis, unbiased random walk or a generalized random walk - and identify the model that describes the observed trend best \citep{Hunt2010}.
The development of body size or any other trait over time can follow different evolutionary trajectories, that describe general trends of trait evolution. If a trait changes in a way where it fluctuates around a mean so that the net change over time is near zero, this obersvation is described as stasis \citep{Hunt2006}. The variance around the mean, referred to as volatility, can be high or low in this case, but the defining property is that these fluctuations result in no change after all \citep{Hunt2006}.
If a trait does show a net change, this change can either be directional, referred to as a generalized random walk, or non-directional, which is described as an unbiased random walk \citep{Hunt2004,Hunt2015}.

Changes in body size on the clade level can either be due to selective forces affecting the whole clade (trends) or individual species being influenced by different causes (tendencies) \citep{Hunt2006}. A trend can be an increase or decrease in minimum, mean or maximum size of a clade and can be caused by differing speciation and extinction rates and therefore occur independently of within-lineage tendencies \citep{Smith2016}.
