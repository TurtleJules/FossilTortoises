\section{Introduction}

- Body size as a trait (read Smith, Smith \& Lyons) and over time
why is it interesting?
is there an optimal body size for every organism? how can it be determined? (--> stasis??)

- evolutionary models (read Gene Hunt's paper and Posada, 2003)
-->  make sense of evolutionary modes:
* stasis
* unbiased random walk
* generalized random walk


- body size in tortoises %(why not use biomass? - not necessary)
- distribution of tortoises (?)
- giant tortoises well suited for drifting on ocean currents (Meylan, 2000)

OR
- mammal megafauna extinctions --> giant tortoises

- human and climatic influence

- purpose of this work: determine body size trends in tortoises and identify evolutionary mode (if possible). what lead to extinction?
