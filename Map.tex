\section{Geographical and stratigraphic distribution of body size data}

Body size data was available from all four continents, were testudinidae occur, and over a time period of 20 mya (Fig. \ref{fig:mapBS}, Table \ref{tab:bins}).

--> samples all over the world and over the whole time period with more or less equally distributed sample sizes (over time bins, continents are uneven --> see SAC)
